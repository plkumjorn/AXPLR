I just returned from a 2 night stay at the hotel. I had requested a high floor, quiet room. Neither request was honored. The windows are not well insulated, because the traffic, car horns and sirens continued all night long. On the first night two drunk parties woke us up in the hallway. The safe in our room did not work. Someone had locked it before our arrival. One of the pictures under the tv had been removed, leaving a screw sticking out of the wall. The lights are so dim, that is next to impossible to read. A small alcove with a stained bench had a ""reading light"" that was about 50 watts. Our room key cards didn't work, so we returned to the lobby where they recoded them. Upon returning to our room, they didn't work again and we stood there trying over and over again until finally we succeeded with no help from the staff. The bathroom is small and has no fan, so the steam covers the mirrors, and unless you leave the bathroom door open, it does not clear. On Friday night one small cookie was left in our room. What about a second guest. Are we supposed to split a 2 inch diameter cookie???!!!! On Sunday the phone rang with a 7 am wakeup call. We had not requested to be woken up!!!! The concierge did not know the way to get to O'Hare by train, and gave us a longer route than was necessary. I have stayed in much better hotels in Chicago...quieter and more spacious, more elegant and worth the money. This is definitely not worth $400 a month. (By the way, I live in Washington, DC and am used to city noise. This was unacceptable!)","Pre-test Question 2

I recently had the displeasure of staying at the Conrad Chicago. Although the hotel came with some recommendations from various online websites, my experience was anything but pleasent. First of all, they tell you that check in time is at 3pm. Well I arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm and checked in only to discover that my room was not ready. After waiting for nearly an hour for the room to be ready, I decided to go settle in. The carpets in the room smelled old and musty. Additionally, the bathroom was not in the the cleanest of states and there were numerous noticeable chips, scratches, and dents in the furniture. Although the bed was comfortable, I just couldn't get over the musty smell coming from the carpet. It was very difficult to get the air conditioning to set a comfortable temperature and I did not have a very good nights sleep. All in all, my experience was not the worst I've ever had, but far from anything worth writing home about.","Pre-test Question 3

After recent week stay at the Affinia Hotels, I can definitely say i will be coming back. They offer so many in room amenities and services, Just a very comfortable and relaxed place to be. My most enjoyable experience at the Affinia Hotel was the amazing customization they offered, I would recommend Affinia hotels to anyone looking for a nice place to stay .","Pre-test Question 4

My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. I had contacted the customer service representative prior to our stay to request a quiet suite. When we arrived, she greeted us and confirmed that we were getting exactly what I had requested--and more. Our suite had a partial view of the lake!!! And, we were able to check in early. The service at this hotel is incredible. Everyone made us feel welcome and took care to respond to any question or request that we had. The suite was very quiet even though we were on the east side of the hotel, very near to Michigan Avenue. Housekeeping was prompt and thorough. We really couldn't have asked for a better hotel. We will definitely stay there on future trips to Chicago and will recommend this hotel to anyone who travels there.","Pre-test Question 5

Upon arrival at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago, I was immediately impressed with the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff. From the moment we checked-in until we left; the staff, from the front desk to roomkeeping were extememly pleasant and accomodating. Since we had our two daughters with us, we booked the traditional double room. The room was very nice with comfortable beds and a great view too. It had plenty of room for the four of us--or should I say five of us. The girls did not want to leave home without ChiChi, our teacup Chihuahua. Fortunately, the Amabassador East allows small pets (with a pet waiver). That made everybody happy! The location is great as well. Conviently located. Easy to get to from Lakeshore Drive. Close to the museums. I'm looking forward to my next visit to Chicago. I'll be staying here again!","Pre-test Question 6

I stayed at the Fairmont for a few nights and found the whole experience excellent. I was given a very large room with great views of the city; the breakfast was extremely good; and the location was as central as I could have wished for. The pool was not large but felt luxurious and was great for early morning swims. In the evening I spent some time in the hotel bar with friends and that was excellent too. Highly recommended as a base for exploring Chicago.","Pre-test Question 7

My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience. The hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location. It's in a quiet location, yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to. We upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost. It didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have, but it was elegantly appointed, spacious, and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet. The service was amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, as well as knowledgeable. This was true from the doormen at the front, to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant. Both Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions, and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out. The breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel, this goes for the room service as well. Dinner there was good, but not great. I mentioned almost flawless, as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel. It involved scheduling and was aggravating, as the hotel actively encourages its use. However, Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied, following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with. The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly. Overall, we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits.","Pre-test Question 8

I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my cousins wedding. The service was impeccable. Not only was the staff attentive, they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner. I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy. They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests. The amenities were great, and after an open bar the night before, the Mimosas and brunch buffet couldn't have been better! I would love to have my wedding there.","Pre-test Question 9

This is a great hotel, in a great location, in a great city !!! There's a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part. The rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rocker(s) in the bathroom ... I had the Beatles and although they're not my cup of tea, I was happy enough with George staring back @ me! The hotel itself is on the corner of Michigan Ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants ... try the ""Cheesecake Factory"" or have a meal / cocktail on the top floor of the ""John Hancock Centre"". A slighty longer walk (or a short cab ride) and you're at the ""Navy Pier"" - take a ride on the ""Seadog"" then enjoy all the fun of the fair ... or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music. This hotel (& city) is WELL worth checking out.","Pre-test Question 10

This is a stunning hotel in an excellent location in the greatest of US cities. The entrance and lobby of the hotel indicates its class. The bedrooms are large and comfortable and the customer service is second to none. It is located on South Michigan directly across the road from Grant and Millenium Park. It also has a free shuttle to the Water Tower in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. For Blues fans, Buddy Guy's Legends Club is situated immediately behind the Hotel. Highly recommended.","Pre-test Question 1
We booked our room at the Swissotel on Hotwire for $88 (unbelievable rate!) and were extremely impressed with the Swissotel. The staff was so polite and catered to our every need. The room was oversized, clean, and had a large bathroom. We had a partial view of Lake Michigan, which was an added bonus. On the 42nd floor, they have a spotless workout room and pool with a view of the city and lake from 3 sides. Spectacular! We sat in the hot tub and looked down on Navy Pier. We can't wait to go to the Swissotel again!","Pre-test Question 2

We went to Chicago to see an exhibit at the Art Institute and selected the Fairmont because it was so close. Although the lobby is still being renovated, our experience at the hotel was uniformly positive. The room was nicely sized and newly remodeled and immaculate. The only glitch involved getting the room coffee replenished. The maid does not do that, and by bedtime on the first night, we still didn't have coffee. We called the front desk and they immediately delivered a fresh supply. The restaurant is a little underwhelming, but with so many other places to go within a very few blocks, we probably wouldn't have eaten there any more than we did. After having stayed in close to a dozen different Chicago hotels, this may be the hotel we return to whenever we return.","Pre-test Question 3

My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool, one white phone and one emergency red phone, to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am glad there wasn't an emergency. As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back.","Pre-test Question 4

The room wasvery tiny and was very warm. They give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do. The bathroom is small. The tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review, and does crackle under your feet. I, personally, did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality. The public areas are nice and are good to hang out in. This is basically an old hotel that has been updated. The comment about the closet is true, it is actually indescriable. You can hear everything occuring in the other rooms. The location is convienent but so are many other hotels. If you do stay, fly into Midway, take the Orange Line, you cannot go wrong.","Pre-test Question 5

This is a great hotel! The views are fabulous, the service it friendly and the location is superb. We booked a room on an upper floor and had access to the lounge where breakfast and snacks were available with picture perfect views of the Chicago River. The only negative is that the ceilings in the hall and room are low and can make you feel a little cramped. We booked our room for $89 a night for Memorial Day weekend. It was a steal! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will be returning!","Pre-test Question 6

For a short time during vacation I had rented a room from The Ambassador East Hotel, I have to say I was quite impressed with what I experienced and would referre others looking to stay in a hotel to that given location. The hotel is comfortable and spacey with nice staff who are always polite to aid you whenever it is needed, and trust me I am not the nicest person in the world so this says a lot. The food is good, location is great, everything is easily accessible and all the given luxuries of a hotel are well kept here.","Pre-test Question 7

The Hotel Allegro located in the Chicago Loop, provided my wife and I with one of the worst hotel experiences in recent memory. We ordered the weekend Liquid Therapy package 48 hours prior as noted on their website, but to our surprise when we arrived, our names were nowhere to be found in their system! No room, no accommodations at the restaurant, nothing had been prepared for us and apparently another couple had already reserved the last available slot. A weekend away turned into the weekend from hell when we were asked to take a smaller room than I originally booked, and never did they offer us a replacement dining option! I have a receipt and credit card statement that shows our reservations being made on time. We will never be staying here again.","Pre-test Question 8

We got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in Chicago on 7/24/09. We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $69 (normal rate was around $200). The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed. Hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient. Parking is very expensive at $50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $30. We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere. We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict. They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we didn't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast. Glad we didn't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better. I highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your Chicago visit.","Pre-test Question 9

Advertised as a luxury hotel the Conrad Chicago is more gouge than grand. My wife and I decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in Chicago for our tenth anniversary. After looking at several hotels in the ""Magnificent Mile"" territory of downtown Chicago we selected the Conrad. The Conrad's website impressed us immediately. The pictures of the rooms were lovely, they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions, not that we were planning to watch much tv. We called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system, I was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who couldn't figure out how I was unable to make my reservations via the automated system. In any case I picked the deluxe king-size bed room for two nights in mid September. My wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online, most impressed with the view. It cost a pretty penny, more than I would normally spend on out of town accomidations, but her happiness was worth it. Unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the Conrad. Valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife's purse when unloading the luggage. We spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it. At the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system. I explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king-sized room but at an additional cost. By the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay. That ended when we found out that our ""view"" was of a back alley service corridor. So much for the skyline. Overall, the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow. I hate to be picky but I was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up. The spa had very limited hours as well. Somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams, away from the hotel. It was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count. I would not recommend the Conrad Chicago. I would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in Chicago. I was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid-range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms, but wouldn't have cleaned out so much of my wallet.","Pre-test Question 10

The Hard Rock Hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several colleagues traveling into Chicago.. The location is fantastic - a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as Lake Michigan, Millennium Park, and Art Museum - and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from. My co-works LOVED the exterior of the building, views from the rooms, the art on the walls, and crisp, clean & hip feeling of the hotel, but not ""too over the top"" for ""business"". By far a better experience than your usual ""chain"" hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms. Here you feel special...for the same price. The lobby and bar have fun & cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on Michigan Ave (or catch a real rock star in the lobby!)","Pre-test Question 1
I actually booked this reservation with the hotel over the phone and got a great rate -- much lower than the usual price! It was a lovely hotel, beautifully appointed, walking distance from the places we wanted to go. We would highly recommend the Fairmont.","Pre-test Question 2

This is a great find for downtown Chicago. The price is right and the staff are excellent. As noted, there is construction going on around the hotel, but I didn't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping. I asked for a quiet room on an upper floor, and was gladly given one. The lobby is small, the atmosphere is that of a small boutique hotel. The concierge, Stephanie did a super job in finding us a restaurant and booking us reservations (along with a complimentary appetizer). We had a standard room, and it was spacious, tastefully decorated--everything we needed. The bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub for soaking--and the MP3 compatible radio was a nice perk. Just can't say enough about how nice the staff are--every single person you meet. Would definitely stay here again.","Pre-test Question 3

Stay away from the Hyatt Regency Chicago. I recently had to spend the weekend in Chicago on business, and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town, but alas, I was left disappointed. I arrived in the afternoon, my flight having been delayed, ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening. Unfortunately, my room was not ready. It should have been ready hours earlier, but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff. In any event, I was advised to wait in the bar, creatively named BIG Bar. They seemed annoyed that I wanted only water, not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that I spent time in their hideously noisy establishment--I wanted only to relax in my room. I waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk. Was my room ready yet? 'What room?' they replied. To my astonishment, it seemed that I no longer had a reservation! How this came to pass, I do not know, and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me. I explained that I was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned, or furnished, or renovated, or whatever they were doing to make it ready, but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer, who spake ""Guest Not Found"" or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters. I requested the manager, who was unavailable, presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either. Finally, I admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel, with fewer regrets than I would have imagined, to find a better place to spend the night--a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point. As it was, I found another hotel, better priced, better staffed, and with rooms ready for my custom. So if you are looking an experience like no other, book a room at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. If you want a place to sleep, look elsewhere.","Pre-test Question 4

I arrived here at about 8pm after a flight from California. I didn't know about the renovation when I made the reservations, but that didn't bother me very much. I was helped by a man at the front desk named Ben, who was friendly enough, but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay. He gave me NO information about anything. I had no idea where breakfast was served, or even if there WAS breakfast. There was also an EXTREMELY unpleasant woman working behind the desk(she wasn't wearing a name tag but was African American, slim with short hair) who seemed to be actually radiating hostility. It made me very uncomfortable and needless to say, made me feel unwelcome. I actually felt like I was putting her out by staying in the hotel. I encountered her again the next morning when I had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit, and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness. I also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners. No matter what may be going on in one's life, when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile. I was appalled by her demeanor. My room was alright, there was no clock which I found very odd. Since I came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and I was constantly confused as to which one was correct, especially upon waking up in the morning. It would have been nice to have a clock. There was also no literature on local sites, maps, restaurant menus, or even anything with the hotel's name and address in the room. Also, the mattress was the absolute worst mattress I've ever slept on in my life. I woke up every morning with a sore back and neck. I've had better sleep on a hard, lumpy futon. It was absurd. Like another person posted, my tub did not drain either, and I was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found. Maybe they were around somewhere, but I wasn't made aware of it at check-in, and I didn't want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like I was a burden to the employees. The hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance, but I absolutely would not stay here again. I've had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel, which was a bummer because it was my first visit to Chicago and I had pretty high expectations.","Pre-test Question 5

My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad, unfortunately, we would never stay in this hotel again. The rooms looked nice, but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink. The room service cost was super high - costing us over $100 for 1 burger, 1 order of french toast, 2 pops and 2 desserts. In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake. We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room (we were on the 5th floor, same as the reception desk). They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower. The staff was friendly enough, but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems. There was not even a coffee pot in the room. Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price. NOT worth it!","Pre-test Question 6

I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago. While higher priced, the reviews online plus four stars convinced me. Granted the hotel itself is beautiful, but looks can be deceiving. The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey. The restaurant (Cafe Des Architect) had amazing food, so that was a plus, but the service was awful. I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water! My remote wouldn't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud. The hotel must've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night. The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently. I called twice for more fresh towels. If I wanted this type of experience, I'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel. Same experience, less money!","Pre-test Question 7

The location of this hotel was superb! Our room was spacious and the view was spectacular. The staff at the hotel treated my family with the upmost respect. One of the front desk staff even helped my five year old tie his shoes while we were waiting for the porter. We will stay here again and advise our friends to do the same.","Pre-test Question 8

everything that i read from other reviews was pretty much on the money, they have excellent customer service, the employees there really cared about their guests, there was always coffee, tea, hot chocolate in the lobby, good hot breakfast and dinner with wine and beer, the doormen were nice and willing to help out for directions, the room did the job, there was a kitchen, 2 flat screen tv's, and a pullout couch included, it was close to the ""eL"", but for us we found the buses to be more useful. I would recommend getting a pass, we got a 3 day pass and it was well worth it for $14 which we got at jewel osco, not too far from the hotel, for the most part the majority of the people that were there were older people on a business trip and families, but us three girls didn't mind, so i would definitely recommend this place, it was one of the cheapest places were found out of all the other hotels.","Pre-test Question 9

The Ambassador East Hotel is a terrible place to stay. All of the rooms are old and dirty as though they haven't been cleaned or remodeled for years. The hotel staff is not friendly or accomodating. Do not waste your money in this crappy old hotel full of rude employees.","Pre-test Question 10

Me and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital. We ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here. At first once coming into the room, there was a mildewy smell in the air, which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase. The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well. The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all. To make matters even worse, the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon, when my wife was back from exploring the city. This was simply unacceptable by any standard.","Pre-test Question 1
My stay at the Talbott was a wonderful experience. The service at this upscale hotel was beyond my expectations, the Gold Coast location is close to Michigan Ave, the museums, and many of the other sites Chicago has to offer.If you are visiting Chicago, I highly recommend the Talbott!","Pre-test Question 2

Did not enjoy my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. Firstly, the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful. There was a problem with the reservation and he gave me and my family a lot of hassle. Secondly when we finally got the reservation sorted out, the air conditioning unit in our room would not go below 75 degrees. Considering I paid well over $250 per night for the Romance package reservation, it was below my standards and I will not be heading back to the Omni Chicago Hotel any time soon.","Pre-test Question 3

When I had to visit Chicago for business I asked some of my associates where to stay and several of them recommended the Hotel Allegro. After my stay I can honestly say that I agree. From the luxurious bedding to the technological amenities, everything was thought of. The only place I find more comfortable then this hotel is my actual home. I now know where I will be staying every time I have business in this city, and anyone I know who is doing the same will hear so.","Pre-test Question 4

The hotel is just ok. Stayed there for 5 days when visiting friends. They had a renovation going so there was no lobby, bar or anything. Just a decently furnished room for 200 usd. The renovation was not annoying but i think they ahould charge... much less untill its done. You cant beat the location! Very convenient especially if u like chicqgo nightlife!","Pre-test Question 5

went to chicago for a week in may, decided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton, we were not disapointed. perhaps it was becuse there were quite a few conventions going on and a lot of people were only staying 1 or 2 nights but we got upgraged to exceutive level. we had 2 double beds with a bathroom each. they beds and pillows were too die for, so so comfy ant the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles. all the staff were very helpful. a lot of guests seemed to ignore the staff especially the chamber maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps that why some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful. about 2 blocks away on Harrison is a cafe called ""Orange"" which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast, the cafe and the staff are suberb. expect a 15 min wait on a sat & sun morning.","Pre-test Question 6

We have stayed at several high end places in Chicago and this is still our favorite. Location is superb, staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being cloying. Cornell, at the front desk, is unfailingly helpful as is the concierge. We love the extra room that a suite provides and if you join the frequent guest program, high speed internet is gratis, as is a breakfast beverage delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing. Bedding is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing blackout curtains! We have never had a bad stay at this hotel.","Pre-test Question 7

We had our hotel reservations at another hotel set and after we were reading all of the negative reviews we cancelled and made out reservation at the Hilton - I am so glad we did the hotel was clean, hotel staff was pleasant and helpful and the beds were amazing. We knew we were paying a little more than some other hotels but it was well worth every penny.","Pre-test Question 8

when i first checked the hotel's website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there. but i was totally disappointed once i got there, first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor , and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one, it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that. then when i was trying to enjoy the view, they windows were all dusty and dirty. so i decided to get out of the room , and i went to the pool and it wasnt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture . so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse!. i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable; the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww!, its all i can say about this hotel.","Pre-test Question 9

After considering several hotels in the area, my family and I finally decided, unfortunately, on Homewood Suites, for our long weekend vacation. Overall, the experience left much to be desired. The breakfast buffet consisted of cold scrambled eggs and greasy pastries. The linens on one of our beds seemed dirty, and when I told the hotel staff and asked them to be replaced, the woman rolled her eyes and had a very unprofessional attitude. I would not come back here ever.","Pre-test Question 10

Great place, great room, great location. Even though there was a big meeting going on (Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns) the only consequence for us was slow elevators. Ballroom is amazing, shops on ground floor a nice throwback. Lake views from upper floors -- we were on 17 I think -- are worth it. Concierge advice about restaurants etc was excellent. Definitly would return.","Pre-test Question 1
I stayed here in the last weekend of September 2010 for the Bears vs Packers Monday Night game. My room rocked! I had a pretty big flat screen, and a super soft bed. The room was clean and stylish, and the staff was very courteous from check-in to check-out. My favorite part was the amazing bathroom - way better than mine at home. I definitely had a great escape that weekend and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to relax.","Pre-test Question 2

So...the location to the Clark/Lake train stop is great...and that is the only thing that is great with the hotel. The wall are very thin...so much you can hear giggling and early morning housekeeping conversations in the hallway. There is no coffee maker in the room, however; free coffee is available in the lobby...becuase everyone wants to go to the lobby first thing in the morning??? Finally, the ""business center"" is a pay for use set-up...no courtesty internet usage or printing. Lastly...they bathroom is micro-tiny and lacks in counterspace and comfort.","Pre-test Question 3

We stayed in the Conrad for 4 nights just before Thanksgiving. We had a corner room overlooking N Michigan Av and the Tribune Building. To say this is a 5 star hotel is to damn this place with faint praise - it is wonderful. The staff were unbelievably helpful. The standard of the room was superb - HD plasma screens, luxury bedlinens, iPod radio, huge bathroom. Location is unbeatable - right in the heart of everything - watched the whole Light Festival parade from the window. Breakfasts were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service. Would have no hesitation recommending or staying again in this hotel - 5 out of 5.","Pre-test Question 4

I can only confirm the positve reviews previously mentioned. We stayed in room 1112, King with River View. No noise and very comfortable.The price was a bargain at $191 a night. I would stay here again. The ""L"" from Midway Airport lets you off about two blocks from the Hotel. It's a $2 ride - no need for a $40 taxi ride.","Pre-test Question 5

I booked this hotel with great expectations. I had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago. Upon arriving to the hotel (at the exact time I indicated in my reservation) I was told I've been ""downgraded"" to a lesser quality room. I travel very often and never had this before. Moreover, I did not hear a single ""I'm sorry"", it was like usual business. What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me ""I will decrease the rate for you"" ""what do you think, nice eh?"" like he was doing me a favor!!!! They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course (which is the legal thing to do, since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money). They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value. I did not know what to say, since this never happened to me before, also with family present did not want to start arguing. The rooms were nice (not as nice as I thought) and location is good, however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this. That is enough for me not to go back again.","Pre-test Question 6

DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!! I would have certainly expected more from the Hilton, especially due to the price I paid for my room and the way the hotel is portrayed. Upon arriving at the hotel I found only one receptionist working and she was too busy texting on her mobile phone to check me in! I had to wait 15 mins before checking in and she made me feel like I was inconveniencing her! When I finally got into my room I was appalled. I had a non smoking reservation and the room stank of smoke and there were several visible cigarette burns in the comforter and the carpet. I called down to reception and to confirm that I was in a non smoking room, which I was advised that I was. I had to argue with the receptionist over the room for 10 mins before she agreed to switch my room for another one. One I entered my new room, I found that once again it stank of smoke, but after being too exhausted from my flight I decided that I would sort it out with reception in the morning. BAD IDEA! I curled up and went to sleep and awoke to the go to the bathroom around 2am where I noticed my legs were COVERED in red welts! I immediately rushed back into the bedroom and through back the covers to find my bed teaming with bed bugs. I packed my stuff and checked out that night, however a refund was refused. I have since contacted the head office and I am awaiting a response. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!","Pre-test Question 7

The Palmer House Hilton in Chicago is by far the best experience I have ever had away from home. From the moment you walk into the elegantly appointed lobby, you will never want to leave. The multiple ballrooms, board rooms and private dining rooms make this the perfect site for weddings or business events. If you're looking for leisure activities, there are two bars, the Lockwood Wine Cellar, and an indoor pool. The staff is professional, friendly and helpful. Room service is excellent, and the hotel is conveniently placed to several major attractions in the city.","Pre-test Question 9

My first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews. For some reason, I kept being disappointed at every turn. Noisy room on the 4th floor. Could not get the room to cool down - it was stifling. BE WARNED - No water, no mini-bar no vending machine, no nothing once you get in your room. You might as well be in prison. They have coffee in the morning, but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days. I guess that is convenient for them, but what about me? Workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest. The only treadmill I could get on was broken. Guess what a cooler with water in it! Oh no - it was only stocked for one day. After that nothing. Way to set expectations and then fail to deliver. Same with towels - one day they have them - next day they don't. They essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $10 charge for wireless (go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free). They should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach. I have stayed at much better for less. Won't be coming back.","Pre-test Question 10

What was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in Chicago turned into a complete disaster. The first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of 6 was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit in...they knew we had 6! We ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel. When we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on 3 different floors despite our request for rooms near each other. After some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor, unfortunately one of the rooms hadn't even been cleaned which meant more waiting around. The staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating. On our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 5:30am. Despite my calls to the front desk, the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes. We also didn't know the hotel was sooo pet friendly. One morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door. I understand they allow pets, but really...people need to clean up after their animals...or have some dog free floors. While Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms, their service was terrible, the staff was rude, and I still can't get over that dog poo in the hallway. I definitely won't be staying here again.","Tutorial Question 1

During my recent trip to Chicago, I stayed at the Ambassador East hotel, which is located in the downtown are. I have to say I was not pleased with my stay there. For one, I had requested that my room have one king sized bed when I called for reservations, however, when I arrived, the hotel lobby clerk said they did not have any king sized beds left and I had to settle with two double sized beds. When I told the clerk that a king sized was promised when i made the reservation, he just shrugged his shoulders. When I got to my room, I found it to be very small. There was supposed to be a small refrigerator in the room. There wasn't, although I did not bother to complain after all it did when they gave me the wrong bed. At night, there seemed to be some sort of convention being held at the hotel. I did not figure what the convention was for, but their attendees liked to stay up until the early morning and made way too much noise. I called the front desk several times complaining about the noise. Each time they assured me they would deal with the noise, but the racket never dissipated and I finally gave up getting any sleep. I did go back to the lobby before my trip ended to complain of the poor service that they have given me, the manager said that she felt sorry for the trouble I had been having at the hotel, but did not offer any refund or consolation for the trouble. When I left the Ambassador East, I vowed that if I ever returned to Chigaco, I would never stay at this place again.","Tutorial Question 2

My wife and I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago and enjoyed everything about the Hotel. Most importantly our room was perfect with plenty of space, great jazz CD's in the room, wonderful bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The staff was very helpful with every request. The Amalfi offers a great continential breakfast on every floor each morning with good coffee and a great selection of pastry's, fruit's and jucie's. We also enjoyed the managers receptions one evening where they offer a great choice of complementary cocktails and antipasta's for their guests. Would highly recommend this hotel.","Tutorial Question 3

I stayed here last August and I'm truly glad that I will never have to stay here again. The website does a great job of creating an illusion. The rooms are so much smaller than it seems on the website. I thought the Monaco was walking distance to a few nightclubs but it isnt. The wireless internet is free but it is extremely slow. For such a ""classy"" hotel, there isnt a pool. At $46 per night, the on-site parking is way too expensive for guests. All and all, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.","Tutorial Question 4

Any traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth: eventually the lodging deteriorates. But you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time! I have been staying at the Talbott for several decades. Yes, changes have been made, like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance, most recently. But other things have gone downhill. For the last several stays I have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service. Rates have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions. This is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of The Talbott, but not this less-than-maintained lodging. I, personally, am shopping for a new home away from home.","Tutorial Question 5

This is a beautiful hotel with a great view of the Chicago River and a short walk to all the best places to visit in the city! I had an unbelievably pleasant and relaxing stay with an in-room massage and fantastic room service. If you're looking for a vacation in Chicago and want to experience the best the city has to offer as well as live in luxury and comfort, I highly recommend this hotel and I would definitely come again!","Tutorial Question 6

My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago for our anniversary. The hotel was beautiful and luxurious as one would expect from a Hilton brand hotel in a major city. The service was excellent with check-in and check-out going smoothly. The location of the hotel was ideal for us as we had plans to attend the theater, visit the Lincoln Park zoo and picnic by the lake. All of these were very close to our hotel. The price was reasonable for the location and luxurious accommodations. We also enjoyed the hotel restaurant and lounge. Highly recommend.","Tutorial Question 7

First, several day s prior to my stay, I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service Saturday and Sunday. Saturday they didn't bring breakfast - and when I called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge. When they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing.. and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday. I was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night. The food was limp and uninspired. Further, I ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon. When I called in-room dining to request a spoon, I was told one would be forthcoming. 15 minutes later, a waiter arrived with a menu. When I explained I already had food and I didn't need a menu - I needed a spoon, he had the audacity to argue with me. I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so. Another 15 minutes (and one bowl of cold soup) later I decided to call in-room dining back to request (again) they send someone with a spoon. They too argued with me and expressed that they'd already sent someone with a spoon. I explained that they had not - that I had received a menu I didn't request, but that no spoon was forthcoming. Another 15 minutes later, a spoon finally arrived. Thanks - for charging me $100+ so that I could argue over cold, flavorless food. In addition to the gross customer service, surly attitude, and sorry food, I found the room woefully lacking. It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell. Further, I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators... I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went.","Tutorial Question 8

The elevator system was impossible. It seems they were trying to improve it but only made it worse. Many people waited 15+ minutes and some bailed out to the stair wells. It happened several times. I had read about it before booking but guess I didn't take it seriously. It'd be a deal breaker for any future return unless I heard clearly it was improved. Also, I always think it's lame that you have to pay extra for WiFi. Area recommendations North Michigan Avenue and Lake front areas are best.","Tutorial Question 9

We booked this hotel using points on our credit card. When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by a friendly face. We arrived several hours before check-in. However, they let us check-in early. They also gave us a free room upgrade. The hotel is absolutely stunning! In addition, it is off of State Street. There are many things to do - shopping, dinning, theater. It is also close to public transportation if you would like to go to the United Center or the airport. The hotel also allowed us to have a late check-out at no additional charge. The room was so dark and quiet we slept in.","Tutorial Question 10

I want to recognize so many people who were exemplary in their service. 1) Sylvia Rollins, Head Concierge. I wanted a fairly last minute reservation at MK restaurant. I spoke with Sylvia on the phone just a few days prior to arrival and within 15 minutes had the desired reservation. 2) Ryan Lettier, Concierge, provided us detailed information on the architectural cruises. Our morning cruise ended up being cancelled by the tour operator and Ryan provided a late check out time to cover us until we could get back to the Monaco. 3) Turndown service was provided as requested and housekeeping in general seemed to be at a high standard 4) Even the bellman went out of their way to ask if we knew how to get the train etc when leaving the hotel. The rooms are tastfully furnished in that whimiscal Hotel Monaco feel. Beds and bedding both very comfortable. The complimentary happy hour and morning coffee/tea service were both very utililzed by the hotel guests.","Tutorial Question 1

I stayed at the intercontinental during the last weekend in September for a ""pleasure trip"" -- the InterContinental was in a great location and the staff was excellent. The room was clean and comfortable -- and came equipped with a new LG flat panel tv. Had breakfast at Zest (hotel restaurant) -- a bit pricey but decent if you want a buffet. The hotel is in walking distance to millenium park, museums and the aquarium. There is also a lot of shopping - window shopping is best though, considering the sales tax is 9.5%! (and possibly raising to 11%) Great stay. I highly recommend it and would stay there again.","Tutorial Question 2

I have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood, cost and amenities. The hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open, you wouldn't know it. You need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock. The beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a ""nicer historic hotel."" I will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime. It was a very frustrating experience.","Tutorial Question 3

I was really excited when we booked a night at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. It was actually beyond our budget, but my husband and I needed a weekend away, so I decided to splurge for the occasion. WORST WASTE OF MY MONEY EVER!!! Our room was smaller than pictured online, and it looked like the maid didn't vacuum the carpet! We visited the hotel restaurant, Angels and Kings, one night for dinner and the drinks were overpriced and my husband's steak was cooked wrong (he ordered medium, but received a well-done steak). By the end of our trip we were so glad to leave, but they were under-staffed and the Sunday morning checkout line was so long that we waited in line for 30 minutes until we could check out. Chicago was a fun city, but next time we return I'll be choosing a different hotel - and I suggest you do too!!","Tutorial Question 4

I stayed three nights recently at the Hilton Homewood Suites- Downtown Chicago. Overall I can't rate this establishment highly. The person at the front desk was disorganized- and took over 10 minutes even to find my reservation. Once I finally got my key, the desk person just thrust the keycard at me like she was happy to be rid of me. It didn't get any better when I got to my suite. The bed was poorly made, and I found a couple of long blonde hairs on one of the pillows. The room was very stuffy, and I swear might have even had a vague pet smell. My shower was not very clean- notable hard water stains on the shower door,and the bathroom sink had a small continuous drip. Also, the carpets didn't seem fresh and even had high traffic dirt noticable. I also visited their small gym/workout area and was disappointed there also. It had limited equipment that was in poor repair. The floor in there was even slippery, which made it a definite trip hazard. While the indoor pool looked good, as I dipped into it, the water felt a bit slimy and did not have a good smell. All in all, the amenities, the unfriendly service, and the sub-standard cleanliness makes this hotel one I would definitely not recommend to anyone. When that is paired with their sky high room rates, it's just not a place that should earn any repeat guests.","Tutorial Question 5

We stay at the Palmer House when we attend conferences in Chicago. It is a stately building. But this year, there were ... problems we have not had before. First, they now have wi-fi available, but it is not free. The cost is $7.50 per hour. On-line it indicated that Hilton hotels charge about $4, but this was almost double. Many hotels have free wi-fi. Wi-fi is wi-fi, so the level of service is not a factor that could justify this exorbitant cost. They also charge for their fitness center, even when you are only going to use the machines. There is no business center in-house for copies, etc. Our bed was against a wall that separated us from the bathroom in the next room. It did not separate us from the bathroom noises. When someone took a shower (at 5:30 a.m.), the pipes ""sung"" like old pipes do,but very loudly. An empty wine glass sat outside someone's room door for days without being picked up by housekeeping. The concierge desk had only one person and there was always a line. If you called down, you were put on hold while they dealt with the people in the line. The staff were all very nice, and the location can't be beat, but the luxury prices for normal services felt like a ripoff this year. I doubt we'll return....","Tutorial Question 6

I stayed in on of The James one bedroom apartments for two weeks while in Chicago visiting my daughter. The pre-arrival assistant was incredibly helpful in acquiring some necessities I forgot to pack and left them in my room for me. Later in the week I treated myself to an Asha Massage from their lengthy list of delicious spa services. Afterward I smelled wonderful and was the most relaxed I'd been in years. My room was clean and modern, yet warm and comforting with dark wood tones and lush bedding. I'll certainly be staying with them again in the future.","Tutorial Question 7

I was extremely disappointed with my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. It was a hot summer day and I turned on the shower and only drips of hot water came out. I called to complain and they assured me that someone would be in my room to fix the shower or show me how to use it. I felt the person I spoke to was rude to me. They were not accepting responsibility, but talking down to me as if I was stupid. After waiting 30 minutes a bell hop came up to show me how to use the shower. This was not a service person. He could not get the shower to work either and apologized for the problem I was having. He expected a tip and complained when I did not give him one. Nobody came up after that. I was told I could switch to a different room, so I had to pack up my belongings and move to another floor. The shower did work in this other room, but I didn't have the view of the city that I had in the first room. I was looking at a brick wall. Plus there was a party in the next room that was so loud it kept me up all night. I complained and the hotel staff told me they were VIPs and could not do anything about the noise. This hotel was overpriced and my stay was miserable. Do not go to the Omni Hotel. I've stayed in $50 a night motels with better service.","Tutorial Question 8

A bunch of us got together and we had a great time in this hotel we asked for limes and they gave us like a punch bowl of them the rooms were so awesome you really have to see it to believe how extradionary this hotel is i love the decorations on every floor and being surrounded by such elegance. Will definitely stay here again","Tutorial Question 9

When you enter the lobby at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel you immediately see that this is a special place where you are going to be pampered. The staff are very friendly and helpful and seem genuinely happy to assist you in any way they can. The check in process is smooth and friendly as I expected. When you enter your room the decor catches your eye. Luxurious yet not stuffy is how I describe it. The restroom tub is large and made of marble. The whole room is tasteful and made to make you feel special yet at home. I highly recommend The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel to anybody looking to escape for a while.","Tutorial Question 10

In my experience the Ambassador hotel didn't seem to be a 3 1/2 star establishment. The building and lobby were nice but the hotel room was extremely dated. The carpeting was very old and worn. The floor - carpeting and tile both seemed dirty which made me very uncomfortable. I would imagine that many years ago this was a very nice hotel. Currently, it's indespirate need of renovation.","Tutorial Question 1

This lovely hotel has only six floors, making it easy to get to elevators and down to reception. The building is dwarfed amongst all the skyscrapers around it. Trump's huge new tower is just down the street. The Amalfi looks recently refurbished, very modern, but warm and inviting. Bedrooms quite spacious with lovely linens and very, very comfortable beds. Bathroom quite small but roomy enough, with Aveda tolietries and constant hot water in the showers. Continental style breakfast is set out fresh every morning in front of the elevator of every floor.

Our stay at the James in late last August exceeded our expectations. My husband was in Chicago for a business trip, and I tagged along to have some time away from our day to day life. When we entered the hotel we were greeted acknowledged the minute we walked through the doors, and the staff member at the front desk was extremely friendly. He met our needs in a timely manner and patiently answered our questions. The lobby was clean and the ambiance was impressive. Our room was also very clean. I could not have found a better room for those two nights of peace and quiet. The bed was comfortable, and the bedding was the type you could slip into and drift off in. It has been awhile since I have stayed at a hotel where the comforter was not scratchy or too thin. My husband actually commented that he had not seen me sleep that soundly in over a month. The bathroom was also impressive. The water pressure was not something I had to mess with to get perfect, and the heater took no time at all to warm up. Even though I had brought my own shampoo and conditioner, I did give the amenities in the bathroom a try, and like everything else they exceeded my expectations. I did not get a chance to check out the conference rooms, however, my husband had nothing but great things to say about the qualities of the facilities. I truly enjoyed the location and ambiance of this hotel, and if we are ever in the Chicago area again we will definitely be staying here. This hotel met all of our needs from relaxation to business to pleasure.","Tutorial Question 3

WARNING! My stay at the Talbott Hotel will go down in history as one of my worst experiences staying in hotels. I was excited for a weekend getaway with a few friends. After receiving a few positive recommendations and looking at their website we decided to stay at the Talbott. They were promoting up to $30 breakfast credit per day. And breakfast is my favorite meal so this was already looking like a great time. Upon our arrival we were greeted by an employee (which we wouldn't have known had he not told us) that was not only rude but made sexual advances at one of the ladies on our group. Once we talked with a manager about the incident outside he assured us that he would take care of the issue and even upgraded us to King suites instead of the double size rooms we originally reserved. If someone had blindfolded me and took me into one of these rooms I would have sworn we were at Motel 6, not a luxury hotel in Chicago. The linens were stained, room smelled of smoke and had another odor that was similar to old cat pee. I was truly disgusted. After a night out on the town we came back to our disgusting rooms to get some sleep. The next morning I was excited for our breakfast that was highly recommended by the hotel and other guests. I have to say it was one of the worst breakfasts I have ever eaten. The toast was stale, eggs were made from powder instead of real eggs, and the juice they served was sour. I would never recommend this as a place to stay. I would suggest the Red Roof Inn over this place anytime.","Tutorial Question 4

The historic feel of the hotel really had a strong influence on my choice to book this hotel. Unfortunately, the ambiance of the hotel could not make up for the rest of its shortcomings. The front desk staff was rude, the doormen were usually busy chatting or playing on their cell phones instead of greeting us or opening the door. There are three elevators but good luck with them all working. They are very very small and when only one is up and running...you end up waiting a long time for one. Not fun when you are on the 12th floor. The room was TINY and the air conditioning did not work at all...the room felt damp and miserable. We put the thermostat as low as it would let us (65) and the room never went below 78. (and it was 107 outside the whole trip!!!). There really are no amenities inside the hotel other than an ice machine and a slightly overpriced restaurant. Internet is not free either...

I have been meaning to write a review of the Omni but wasn't sure if people would believe it as most of the reviews are quite high. We stayed here for 5 nights. The room was fine when I walked in. But about five minutes or so I was all congested. Thought it might have been from the flight. I then noticed there was dust everywhere. The TV, the Minibar, and worst of all the air vent. It was literally hanging off the vent. I called down to front desk they said they would send housekeeping up. After 30 minutes of waiting and noticing other things. A bathroom door that wouldn't close, broken light fixtures, a toe or fingernail on the bed. broken bathroom fixtures. This place was a dump. Hopefully the pictures will show some of it. I could go on and on. Almost 90 minutes later the hotel manager came up to look at the room, Both he and head of housekeeping were ""shocked"" at the room. We were moved to another room, not as large as this one was because the hotel was completely booked, or so I was told. I stayed at the Omni once prior and have to say was very impressed. But this will be the last time. Sad to say. The hotel did cut the rate of our 5 day stay, but doesn't explain how a hotel of this caliber let a room like this pass any inspection.","Tutorial Question 6

My husband and I recently stayed at the Conrad Chicago for three nights, a Thursday through Saturday. Let me say we were less than pleased with our experience. We chose to stay in the ""King Bed Deluxe Room"" and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations. Upon entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly, the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser. The room was size was average, and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room. The major annoyance was how loud people were. We came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running. That is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel. You can expect a loud guest maybe once, but every night is ridiculous. The service was also extremely sub par. We had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work. One day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me. She completely disregarded the sign, did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in. It scared me and I'm just glad I was not getting out of the shower or changing. So to sum up, we will never stay at the Conrad again, we will never recommend it to anyone else, and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in Chicago.","Tutorial Question 9

I recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel and I could not be more pleased. The hotel is sleek from the elegant lobby to the modern, stylish rooms. The rooms are something truly special with huge, soft beds with the most luxurious sheets you have ever seen and felt. The bathrooms are beautiful with cool marble tiles and a gorgeous glass and marble shower/tub. If that wasn't enough each room has a crisp 32"" LCD TV that displays TV in the most beautiful and clear way with an absolutely amazing sound system. When you finally make it out of your room, down the grand stair case you need not look further for dinner than the hotel restaurant. It is called Cafe des Architectes and like the hotel itself melds a modern sophistication with classic French techniques. Their wine list is amazing but their prices are fantastic for a hotel near the Magnificent mile. A full dinner including appetizer, main course, and dessert can be had for $45, amazing. If you are looking for a modern, urban, chic hotel in Chicago then look no further, the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel is your only real choice.","Tutorial Question 10

I stayed at the Hilton Chicago during a recent business trip. I elected to go with their Executive Suite upgrade. All I can say is, ""What upgrade?"" It's barely anything above what you get normally. And for the price I paid, I was expecting much better acommodations. Because I arrived around 10:30 the night I checked in (delayed flight) I did not get the concierge service as it stops at 10. I find that an odd hour to stop a service like that especially when you're expecting a guest who has not checked in yet. Beyond that, it took them 20 minutes to get me into my room. First it was a room mix-up, then it was a missing key card. That was extremely frustrating as I was tired and I had a presentation to give the next morning. Speaking of the next morning, the complimentary breakfast was a joke. When I just want a stale muffin and a bad cup of coffee for breakfast, I'll stay at the next Super 8 I find. And the wireless internet in the room that you actually have to pay for on top of everything else was a horrible connection with angonizingly slow speed. I will not be staying at the Hilton Chicago every again even though I frequent Chicago. This tops out my list of horrible hotel experiences by a long shot.","Tutorial Question 1

This lovely hotel has only six floors, making it easy to get to elevators and down to reception. The building is dwarfed amongst all the skyscrapers around it. Trump's huge new tower is just down the street. The Amalfi looks recently refurbished, very modern, but warm and inviting. Bedrooms quite spacious with lovely linens and very, very comfortable beds. Bathroom quite small but roomy enough, with Aveda tolietries and constant hot water in the showers. Continental style breakfast is set out fresh every morning in front of the elevator of every floor. Great to stumble out of bed and grab a coffee etc (robes & slippers provided) without having to get dressed for a formal breakfast.

I just returned from a 2 night stay at the hotel. I had requested a high floor, quiet room. Neither request was honored.

I recently had the displeasure of staying at the Conrad Chicago. Although the hotel came with some recommendations from various online websites, my experience was anything but pleasent. First of all, they tell you that check in time is at 3pm. Well I arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm and checked in only to discover that my room was not ready. After waiting for nearly an hour for the room to be ready, I decided to go settle in. The carpets in the room smelled old and musty. Additionally, the bathroom was not in the the cleanest of states and there were numerous noticeable chips, scratches, and dents in the furniture. Although the bed was comfortable, I just couldn't get over the musty smell coming from the carpet. It was very difficult to get the air conditioning to set a comfortable temperature and I did not have a very good nights sleep. All in all, my experience was not the worst I've ever had, but far from anything worth writing home about.

My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. I had contacted the customer service representative prior to our stay to request a quiet suite. When we arrived, she greeted us and confirmed that we were getting exactly what I had requested--and more. Our suite had a partial view of the lake!!! And, we were able to check in early. The service at this hotel is incredible. Everyone made us feel welcome and took care to respond to any question or request that we had. The suite was very quiet even though we were on the east side of the hotel, very near to Michigan Avenue. Housekeeping was prompt and thorough. We really couldn't have asked for a better hotel. We will definitely stay there on future trips to Chicago and will recommend this hotel to anyone who travels there.

Upon arrival at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago, I was immediately impressed with the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff. From the moment we checked-in until we left; the staff, from the front desk to roomkeeping were extememly pleasant and accomodating. Since we had our two daughters with us, we booked the traditional double room. The room was very nice with comfortable beds and a great view too. It had plenty of room for the four of us--or should I say five of us. The girls did not want to leave home without ChiChi, our teacup Chihuahua. Fortunately, the Amabassador East allows small pets (with a pet waiver). That made everybody happy! The location is great as well. Conviently located. Easy to get to from Lakeshore Drive. Close to the museums. I'm looking forward to my next visit to Chicago. I'll be staying here again!

I stayed at the Fairmont for a few nights and found the whole experience excellent. I was given a very large room with great views of the city; the breakfast was extremely good; and the location was as central as I could have wished for. The pool was not large but felt luxurious and was great for early morning swims. In the evening I spent some time in the hotel bar with friends and that was excellent too. Highly recommended as a base for exploring Chicago.

My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience. The hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location. It's in a quiet location, yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to. We upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost. It didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have, but it was elegantly appointed, spacious, and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet. The service was amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, as well as knowledgeable. This was true from the doormen at the front, to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant. Both Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions, and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out. The breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel, this goes for the room service as well. Dinner there was good, but not great. I mentioned almost flawless, as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel. It involved scheduling and was aggravating, as the hotel actively encourages its use. However, Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied, following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with. The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly. Overall, we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits.

I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my cousins wedding. The service was impeccable. Not only was the staff attentive, they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner. I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy. They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests. The amenities were great, and after an open bar the night before, the Mimosas and brunch buffet couldn't have been better! I would love to have my wedding there.

This is a great hotel, in a great location, in a great city !!! There's a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part. The rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rocker(s) in the bathroom ... I had the Beatles and although they're not my cup of tea, I was happy enough with George staring back @ me! The hotel itself is on the corner of Michigan Ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants ... try the ""Cheesecake Factory"" or have a meal / cocktail on the top floor of the ""John Hancock Centre"". A slighty longer walk (or a short cab ride) and you're at the ""Navy Pier"" - take a ride on the ""Seadog"" then enjoy all the fun of the fair ... or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music. This hotel (& city) is WELL worth checking out.

This is a stunning hotel in an excellent location in the greatest of US cities. The entrance and lobby of the hotel indicates its class. The bedrooms are large and comfortable and the customer service is second to none. It is located on South Michigan directly across the road from Grant and Millenium Park. It also has a free shuttle to the Water Tower in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. For Blues fans, Buddy Guy's Legends Club is situated immediately behind the Hotel. Highly recommended.

My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. I had contacted the customer service representative prior to our stay to request a quiet suite. When we arrived, she greeted us and confirmed that we were getting exactly what I had requested--and more. Our suite had a partial view of the lake!!! And, we were able to check in early. The service at this hotel is incredible. Everyone made us feel welcome and took care to respond to any question or request that we had. The suite was very quiet even though we were on the east side of the hotel, very near to Michigan Avenue. Housekeeping was prompt and thorough. We really couldn't have asked for a better hotel. We will definitely stay there on future trips to Chicago and will recommend this hotel to anyone who travels there.

Upon arrival at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago, I was immediately impressed with the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff. From the moment we checked-in until we left; the staff, from the front desk to roomkeeping were extememly pleasant and accomodating. Since we had our two daughters with us, we booked the traditional double room. The room was very nice with comfortable beds and a great view too. It had plenty of room for the four of us--or should I say five of us. The girls did not want to leave home without ChiChi, our teacup Chihuahua. Fortunately, the Amabassador East allows small pets (with a pet waiver). That made everybody happy! The location is great as well. Conviently located. Easy to get to from Lakeshore Drive. Close to the museums. I'm looking forward to my next visit to Chicago. I'll be staying here again!

I stayed at the Fairmont for a few nights and found the whole experience excellent. I was given a very large room with great views of the city; the breakfast was extremely good; and the location was as central as I could have wished for. The pool was not large but felt luxurious and was great for early morning swims. In the evening I spent some time in the hotel bar with friends and that was excellent too. Highly recommended as a base for exploring Chicago.

My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience. The hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location. It's in a quiet location, yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to. We upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost. It didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have, but it was elegantly appointed, spacious, and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet. The service was amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, as well as knowledgeable. This was true from the doormen at the front, to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant. Both Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions, and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out. The breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel, this goes for the room service as well. Dinner there was good, but not great. I mentioned almost flawless, as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel. It involved scheduling and was aggravating, as the hotel actively encourages its use. However, Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied, following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with. The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly. Overall, we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits.

I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my cousins wedding. The service was impeccable. Not only was the staff attentive, they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner. I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy. They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests. The amenities were great, and after an open bar the night before, the Mimosas and brunch buffet couldn't have been better! I would love to have my wedding there.

This is a great hotel, in a great location, in a great city !!! There's a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part. The rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rocker(s) in the bathroom ... I had the Beatles and although they're not my cup of tea, I was happy enough with George staring back @ me! The hotel itself is on the corner of Michigan Ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants ... try the ""Cheesecake Factory"" or have a meal / cocktail on the top floor of the ""John Hancock Centre"". A slighty longer walk (or a short cab ride) and you're at the ""Navy Pier"" - take a ride on the ""Seadog"" then enjoy all the fun of the fair ... or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music. This hotel (& city) is WELL worth checking out.

This is a stunning hotel in an excellent location in the greatest of US cities. The entrance and lobby of the hotel indicates its class. The bedrooms are large and comfortable and the customer service is second to none. It is located on South Michigan directly across the road from Grant and Millenium Park. It also has a free shuttle to the Water Tower in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. For Blues fans, Buddy Guy's Legends Club is situated immediately behind the Hotel. Highly recommended.

I just returned from a 2 night stay at the hotel . I had requested a high floor , quiet room . Neither request was honored . The windows are not well insulated , because the traffic , car horns and sirens continued all night long . On the first night two drunk parties woke us up in the hallway . The safe in our room did not work . Someone had locked it before our arrival . One of the pictures under the tv had been removed , leaving a screw sticking out of the wall . The lights are so dim , that is next to impossible to read . A small alcove with a stained bench had a "" reading light "" that was about 50 watts . Our room key cards did n't work , so we returned to the lobby where they recoded them . Upon returning to our room , they did n't work again and we stood there trying over and over again until finally we succeeded with no help from the staff . The bathroom is small and has no fan , so the steam covers the mirrors , and unless you leave the bathroom door open , it does not clear . On Friday night one small cookie was left in our room . What about a second guest . Are we supposed to split a 2 inch diameter cookie ? ? ? ! ! ! ! On Sunday the phone rang with a 7 am wakeup call . We had not requested to be woken up ! ! ! ! The concierge did not know the way to get to O'Hare by train , and gave us a longer route than was necessary . I have stayed in much better hotels in Chicago ... quieter and more spacious , more elegant and worth the money . This is definitely not worth $ 400 a month . ( By the way , I live in Washington , DC and am used to city noise . This was unacceptable ! )

I recently had the displeasure of staying at the Conrad Chicago . Although the hotel came with some recommendations from various online websites , my experience was anything but pleasent . First of all , they tell you that check in time is at 3 pm . Well I arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm and checked in only to discover that my room was not ready . After waiting for nearly an hour for the room to be ready , I decided to go settle in . The carpets in the room smelled old and musty . Additionally , the bathroom was not in the the cleanest of states and there were numerous noticeable chips , scratches , and dents in the furniture . Although the bed was comfortable , I just could n't get over the musty smell coming from the carpet . It was very difficult to get the air conditioning to set a comfortable temperature and I did not have a very good nights sleep . All in all , my experience was not the worst I 've ever had , but far from anything worth writing home about .

Upon arrival at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago , I was immediately impressed with the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff . From the moment we checked - in until we left ; the staff , from the front desk to roomkeeping were extememly pleasant and accomodating . Since we had our two daughters with us , we booked the traditional double room . The room was very nice with comfortable beds and a great view too . It had plenty of room for the four of us -- or should I say five of us . The girls did not want to leave home without ChiChi , our teacup Chihuahua . Fortunately , the Amabassador East allows small pets ( with a pet waiver ) . That made everybody happy ! The location is great as well . Conviently located . Easy to get to from Lakeshore Drive . Close to the museums . I 'm looking forward to my next visit to Chicago . I 'll be staying here again !

I stayed at the Fairmont for a few nights and found the whole experience excellent . I was given a very large room with great views of the city ; the breakfast was extremely good ; and the location was as central as I could have wished for . The pool was not large but felt luxurious and was great for early morning swims . In the evening I spent some time in the hotel bar with friends and that was excellent too . Highly recommended as a base for exploring Chicago .

My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience . The hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location . It 's in a quiet location , yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to . We upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost . It did nt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have , but it was elegantly appointed , spacious , and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet . The service was amazing . Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful , as well as knowledgeable . This was true from the doormen at the front , to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant . Both Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions , and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out . The breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel , this goes for the room service as well . Dinner there was good , but not great . I mentioned almost flawless , as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel . It involved scheduling and was aggravating , as the hotel actively encourages its use . However , Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied , following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with . The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly . Overall , we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits .

I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my cousins wedding . The service was impeccable . Not only was the staff attentive , they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner . I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for ! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy . They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests . The amenities were great , and after an open bar the night before , the Mimosas and brunch buffet could n't have been better ! I would love to have my wedding there .

This is a great hotel , in a great location , in a great city ! ! ! There 's a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part . The rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rocker(s ) in the bathroom ... I had the Beatles and although they 're not my cup of tea , I was happy enough with George staring back @ me ! The hotel itself is on the corner of Michigan Ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants ... try the "" Cheesecake Factory "" or have a meal / cocktail on the top floor of the "" John Hancock Centre "" . A slighty longer walk ( or a short cab ride ) and you 're at the "" Navy Pier "" - take a ride on the "" Seadog "" then enjoy all the fun of the fair ... or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music . This hotel ( & city ) is WELL worth checking out .

I just returned from a 2 night stay at the hotel . I had requested a high floor , quiet room . Neither request was honored . The windows are not well insulated , because the traffic , car horns and sirens continued all night long . On the first night two drunk parties woke us up in the hallway . The safe in our room did not work . Someone had locked it before our arrival . One of the pictures under the tv had been removed , leaving a screw sticking out of the wall . The lights are so dim , that is next to impossible to read . A small alcove with a stained bench had a "" reading light "" that was about 50 watts . Our room key cards did n't work , so we returned to the lobby where they recoded them . Upon returning to our room , they did n't work again and we stood there trying over and over again until finally we succeeded with no help from the staff . The bathroom is small and has no fan , so the steam covers the mirrors , and unless you leave the bathroom door open , it does not clear . On Friday night one small cookie was left in our room . What about a second guest . Are we supposed to split a 2 inch diameter cookie ? ? ? ! ! ! ! On Sunday the phone rang with a 7 am wakeup call . We had not requested to be woken up ! ! ! ! The concierge did not know the way to get to O'Hare by train , and gave us a longer route than was necessary . I have stayed in much better hotels in Chicago ... quieter and more spacious , more elegant and worth the money . This is definitely not worth $ 400 a month . ( By the way , I live in Washington , DC and am used to city noise . This was unacceptable ! )

I recently had the displeasure of staying at the Conrad Chicago . Although the hotel came with some recommendations from various online websites , my experience was anything but pleasent . First of all , they tell you that check in time is at 3 pm . Well I arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm and checked in only to discover that my room was not ready . After waiting for nearly an hour for the room to be ready , I decided to go settle in . The carpets in the room smelled old and musty . Additionally , the bathroom was not in the the cleanest of states and there were numerous noticeable chips , scratches , and dents in the furniture . Although the bed was comfortable , I just could n't get over the musty smell coming from the carpet . It was very difficult to get the air conditioning to set a comfortable temperature and I did not have a very good nights sleep . All in all , my experience was not the worst I 've ever had , but far from anything worth writing home about .

My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel . I had contacted the customer service representative prior to our stay to request a quiet suite . When we arrived , she greeted us and confirmed that we were getting exactly what I had requested -- and more . Our suite had a partial view of the lake ! ! ! And , we were able to check in early . The service at this hotel is incredible . Everyone made us feel welcome and took care to respond to any question or request that we had . The suite was very quiet even though we were on the east side of the hotel , very near to Michigan Avenue . Housekeeping was prompt and thorough . We really could n't have asked for a better hotel . We will definitely stay there on future trips to Chicago and will recommend this hotel to anyone who travels there .

Upon arrival at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago , I was immediately impressed with the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff . From the moment we checked - in until we left ; the staff , from the front desk to roomkeeping were extememly pleasant and accomodating . Since we had our two daughters with us , we booked the traditional double room . The room was very nice with comfortable beds and a great view too . It had plenty of room for the four of us -- or should I say five of us . The girls did not want to leave home without ChiChi , our teacup Chihuahua . Fortunately , the Amabassador East allows small pets ( with a pet waiver ) . That made everybody happy ! The location is great as well . Conviently located . Easy to get to from Lakeshore Drive . Close to the museums . I 'm looking forward to my next visit to Chicago . I 'll be staying here again !

I stayed at the Fairmont for a few nights and found the whole experience excellent . I was given a very large room with great views of the city ; the breakfast was extremely good ; and the location was as central as I could have wished for . The pool was not large but felt luxurious and was great for early morning swims . In the evening I spent some time in the hotel bar with friends and that was excellent too . Highly recommended as a base for exploring Chicago .

My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience . The hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location . It 's in a quiet location , yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to . We upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost . It did nt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have , but it was elegantly appointed , spacious , and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet . The service was amazing . Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful , as well as knowledgeable . This was true from the doormen at the front , to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant . Both Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions , and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out . The breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel , this goes for the room service as well . Dinner there was good , but not great . I mentioned almost flawless , as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel . It involved scheduling and was aggravating , as the hotel actively encourages its use . However , Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied , following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with . The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly . Overall , we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits .

I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my cousins wedding . The service was impeccable . Not only was the staff attentive , they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner . I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for ! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy . They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests . The amenities were great , and after an open bar the night before , the Mimosas and brunch buffet could n't have been better ! I would love to have my wedding there .

This is a great hotel , in a great location , in a great city ! ! ! There 's a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part . The rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rocker(s ) in the bathroom ... I had the Beatles and although they 're not my cup of tea , I was happy enough with George staring back @ me ! The hotel itself is on the corner of Michigan Ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants ... try the "" Cheesecake Factory "" or have a meal / cocktail on the top floor of the "" John Hancock Centre "" . A slighty longer walk ( or a short cab ride ) and you 're at the "" Navy Pier "" - take a ride on the "" Seadog "" then enjoy all the fun of the fair ... or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music . This hotel ( & city ) is WELL worth checking out .

I just returned from a 2 night stay at the hotel . I had requested a high floor , quiet room . Neither request was honored . The windows are not well insulated , because the traffic , car horns and sirens continued all night long . On the first night two drunk parties woke us up in the hallway . The safe in our room did not work . Someone had locked it before our arrival . One of the pictures under the tv had been removed , leaving a screw sticking out of the wall . The lights are so dim , that is next to impossible to read . A small alcove with a stained bench had a "" reading light "" that was about 50 watts . Our room key cards did n't work , so we returned to the lobby where they recoded them . Upon returning to our room , they did n't work again and we stood there trying over and over again until finally we succeeded with no help from the staff . The bathroom is small and has no fan , so the steam covers the mirrors , and unless you leave the bathroom door open , it does not clear . On Friday night one small cookie was left in our room . What about a second guest . Are we supposed to split a 2 inch diameter cookie ? ? ? ! ! ! ! On Sunday the phone rang with a 7 am wakeup call . We had not requested to be woken up ! ! ! ! The concierge did not know the way to get to O'Hare by train , and gave us a longer route than was necessary . I have stayed in much better hotels in Chicago ... quieter and more spacious , more elegant and worth the money . This is definitely not worth $ 400 a month . ( By the way , I live in Washington , DC and am used to city noise . This was unacceptable ! )

I recently had the displeasure of staying at the Conrad Chicago . Although the hotel came with some recommendations from various online websites , my experience was anything but pleasent . First of all , they tell you that check in time is at 3 pm . Well I arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm and checked in only to discover that my room was not ready . After waiting for nearly an hour for the room to be ready , I decided to go settle in . The carpets in the room smelled old and musty . Additionally , the bathroom was not in the the cleanest of states and there were numerous noticeable chips , scratches , and dents in the furniture . Although the bed was comfortable , I just could n't get over the musty smell coming from the carpet . It was very difficult to get the air conditioning to set a comfortable temperature and I did not have a very good nights sleep . All in all , my experience was not the worst I 've ever had , but far from anything worth writing home about .

My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel . I had contacted the customer service representative prior to our stay to request a quiet suite . When we arrived , she greeted us and confirmed that we were getting exactly what I had requested -- and more . Our suite had a partial view of the lake ! ! ! And , we were able to check in early . The service at this hotel is incredible . Everyone made us feel welcome and took care to respond to any question or request that we had . The suite was very quiet even though we were on the east side of the hotel , very near to Michigan Avenue . Housekeeping was prompt and thorough . We really could n't have asked for a better hotel . We will definitely stay there on future trips to Chicago and will recommend this hotel to anyone who travels there .

Upon arrival at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago , I was immediately impressed with the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff . From the moment we checked - in until we left ; the staff , from the front desk to roomkeeping were extememly pleasant and accomodating . Since we had our two daughters with us , we booked the traditional double room . The room was very nice with comfortable beds and a great view too . It had plenty of room for the four of us -- or should I say five of us . The girls did not want to leave home without ChiChi , our teacup Chihuahua . Fortunately , the Amabassador East allows small pets ( with a pet waiver ) . That made everybody happy ! The location is great as well . Conviently located . Easy to get to from Lakeshore Drive . Close to the museums . I 'm looking forward to my next visit to Chicago . I 'll be staying here again !

I stayed at the Fairmont for a few nights and found the whole experience excellent . I was given a very large room with great views of the city ; the breakfast was extremely good ; and the location was as central as I could have wished for . The pool was not large but felt luxurious and was great for early morning swims . In the evening I spent some time in the hotel bar with friends and that was excellent too . Highly recommended as a base for exploring Chicago .

My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience . The hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location . It 's in a quiet location , yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to . We upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost . It did nt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have , but it was elegantly appointed , spacious , and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet . The service was amazing . Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful , as well as knowledgeable . This was true from the doormen at the front , to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant . Both Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions , and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out . The breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel , this goes for the room service as well . Dinner there was good , but not great . I mentioned almost flawless , as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel . It involved scheduling and was aggravating , as the hotel actively encourages its use . However , Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied , following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with . The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly . Overall , we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits .

I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my cousins wedding . The service was impeccable . Not only was the staff attentive , they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner . I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for ! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy . They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests . The amenities were great , and after an open bar the night before , the Mimosas and brunch buffet could n't have been better ! I would love to have my wedding there .

This is a great hotel , in a great location , in a great city ! ! ! There 's a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part . The rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rocker(s ) in the bathroom ... I had the Beatles and although they 're not my cup of tea , I was happy enough with George staring back @ me ! The hotel itself is on the corner of Michigan Ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants ... try the "" Cheesecake Factory "" or have a meal / cocktail on the top floor of the "" John Hancock Centre "" . A slighty longer walk ( or a short cab ride ) and you 're at the "" Navy Pier "" - take a ride on the "" Seadog "" then enjoy all the fun of the fair ... or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music . This hotel ( & city ) is WELL worth checking out .

We booked our room at the Swissotel on Hotwire for $88 (unbelievable rate!) and were extremely impressed with the Swissotel. The staff was so polite and catered to our every need. The room was oversized, clean, and had a large bathroom. We had a partial view of Lake Michigan, which was an added bonus. On the 42nd floor, they have a spotless workout room and pool with a view of the city and lake from 3 sides. Spectacular! We sat in the hot tub and looked down on Navy Pier. We can't wait to go to the Swissotel again!

We went to Chicago to see an exhibit at the Art Institute and selected the Fairmont because it was so close. Although the lobby is still being renovated, our experience at the hotel was uniformly positive. The room was nicely sized and newly remodeled and immaculate. The only glitch involved getting the room coffee replenished. The maid does not do that, and by bedtime on the first night, we still didn't have coffee. We called the front desk and they immediately delivered a fresh supply. The restaurant is a little underwhelming, but with so many other places to go within a very few blocks, we probably wouldn't have eaten there any more than we did. After having stayed in close to a dozen different Chicago hotels, this may be the hotel we return to whenever we return.

My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool, one white phone and one emergency red phone, to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am glad there wasn't an emergency. As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back.

The room wasvery tiny and was very warm. They give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do. The bathroom is small.

This is a great hotel! The views are fabulous, the service it friendly and the location is superb. We booked a room on an upper floor and had access to the lounge where breakfast and snacks were available with picture perfect views of the Chicago River.

The Hotel Allegro located in the Chicago Loop, provided my wife and I with one of the worst hotel experiences in recent memory. We ordered the weekend Liquid Therapy package 48 hours prior as noted on their website, but to our surprise when we arrived, our names were nowhere to be found in their system! No room, no accommodations at the restaurant, nothing had been prepared for us and apparently another couple had already reserved the last available slot. A weekend away turned into the weekend from hell when we were asked to take a smaller room than I originally booked, and never did they offer us a replacement dining option!

We got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in Chicago on 7/24/09. We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $69 (normal rate was around $200). The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed. Hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient. Parking is very expensive at $50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $30. We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere. We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict. They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we didn't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast. Glad we didn't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better. I highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your Chicago visit.

Advertised as a luxury hotel the Conrad Chicago is more gouge than grand. My wife and I decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in Chicago for our tenth anniversary. After looking at several hotels in the ""Magnificent Mile"" territory of downtown Chicago we selected the Conrad. The Conrad's website impressed us immediately. The pictures of the rooms were lovely, they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions, not that we were planning to watch much tv. We called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system, I was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who couldn't figure out how I was unable to make my reservations via the automated system. In any case I picked the deluxe king-size bed room for two nights in mid September. My wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online, most impressed with the view. It cost a pretty penny, more than I would normally spend on out of town accomidations, but her happiness was worth it. Unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the Conrad. Valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife's purse when unloading the luggage. We spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it. At the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system. I explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king-sized room but at an additional cost. By the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay. That ended when we found out that our ""view"" was of a back alley service corridor. So much for the skyline. Overall, the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow. I hate to be picky but I was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up. The spa had very limited hours as well. Somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams, away from the hotel. It was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count. I would not recommend the Conrad Chicago. I would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in Chicago. I was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid-range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms, but wouldn't have cleaned out so much of my wallet.

My co-works LOVED the exterior of the building, views from the rooms, the art on the walls, and crisp, clean & hip feeling of the hotel, but not ""too over the top"" for ""business"". By far a better experience than your usual ""chain"" hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms. Here you feel special...for the same price.

We went to Chicago to see an exhibit at the Art Institute and selected the Fairmont because it was so close . Although the lobby is still being renovated , our experience at the hotel was uniformly positive . The room was nicely sized and newly remodeled and immaculate . The only glitch involved getting the room coffee replenished . The maid does not do that , and by bedtime on the first night , we still did n't have coffee . We called the front desk and they immediately delivered a fresh supply . The restaurant is a little underwhelming , but with so many other places to go within a very few blocks , we probably would n't have eaten there any more than we did . After having stayed in close to a dozen different Chicago hotels , this may be the hotel we return to whenever we return .

My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum . I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool , one white phone and one emergency red phone , to call the desk . Both were out of service ! ! ! ! I am glad there was n't an emergency . As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean .... never heard back .

The room wasvery tiny and was very warm . They give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do . The bathroom is small . The tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review , and does crackle under your feet . I , personally , did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality . The public areas are nice and are good to hang out in . This is basically an old hotel that has been updated . The comment about the closet is true , it is actually indescriable . You can hear everything occuring in the other rooms . The location is convienent but so are many other hotels . If you do stay , fly into Midway , take the Orange Line , you can not go wrong .

This is a great hotel ! The views are fabulous , the service it friendly and the location is superb . We booked a room on an upper floor and had access to the lounge where breakfast and snacks were available with picture perfect views of the Chicago River . The only negative is that the ceilings in the hall and room are low and can make you feel a little cramped . We booked our room for $ 89 a night for Memorial Day weekend . It was a steal ! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will be returning !

For a short time during vacation I had rented a room from The Ambassador East Hotel , I have to say I was quite impressed with what I experienced and would referre others looking to stay in a hotel to that given location . The hotel is comfortable and spacey with nice staff who are always polite to aid you whenever it is needed , and trust me I am not the nicest person in the world so this says a lot . The food is good , location is great , everything is easily accessible and all the given luxuries of a hotel are well kept here .

The Hotel Allegro located in the Chicago Loop , provided my wife and I with one of the worst hotel experiences in recent memory . We ordered the weekend Liquid Therapy package 48 hours prior as noted on their website , but to our surprise when we arrived , our names were nowhere to be found in their system ! No room , no accommodations at the restaurant , nothing had been prepared for us and apparently another couple had already reserved the last available slot . A weekend away turned into the weekend from hell when we were asked to take a smaller room than I originally booked , and never did they offer us a replacement dining option ! I have a receipt and credit card statement that shows our reservations being made on time . We will never be staying here again .

We got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in Chicago on 7/24/09 . We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $ 69 ( normal rate was around $ 200 ) . The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed . Hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient . Parking is very expensive at $ 50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $ 30 . We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere . We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict . They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we did n't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast . Glad we did n't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better . I highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your Chicago visit .

Advertised as a luxury hotel the Conrad Chicago is more gouge than grand . My wife and I decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in Chicago for our tenth anniversary . After looking at several hotels in the "" Magnificent Mile "" territory of downtown Chicago we selected the Conrad . The Conrad 's website impressed us immediately . The pictures of the rooms were lovely , they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions , not that we were planning to watch much tv . We called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system , I was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who could n't figure out how I was unable to make my reservations via the automated system . In any case I picked the deluxe king - size bed room for two nights in mid September . My wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online , most impressed with the view . It cost a pretty penny , more than I would normally spend on out of town accomidations , but her happiness was worth it . Unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the Conrad . Valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife 's purse when unloading the luggage . We spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it . At the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system . I explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king - sized room but at an additional cost . By the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay . That ended when we found out that our "" view "" was of a back alley service corridor . So much for the skyline . Overall , the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow . I hate to be picky but I was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up . The spa had very limited hours as well . Somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams , away from the hotel . It was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count . I would not recommend the Conrad Chicago . I would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in Chicago . I was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid - range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms , but would n't have cleaned out so much of my wallet .

The Hard Rock Hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several colleagues traveling into Chicago .. The location is fantastic - a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as Lake Michigan , Millennium Park , and Art Museum - and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from . My co - works LOVED the exterior of the building , views from the rooms , the art on the walls , and crisp , clean & hip feeling of the hotel , but not "" too over the top "" for "" business "" . By far a better experience than your usual "" chain "" hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms . Here you feel special ... for the same price . The lobby and bar have fun & cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on Michigan Ave ( or catch a real rock star in the lobby ! )

We booked our room at the Swissotel on Hotwire for $ 88 ( unbelievable rate ! ) and were extremely impressed with the Swissotel . The staff was so polite and catered to our every need . The room was oversized , clean , and had a large bathroom . We had a partial view of Lake Michigan , which was an added bonus . On the 42nd floor , they have a spotless workout room and pool with a view of the city and lake from 3 sides . Spectacular ! We sat in the hot tub and looked down on Navy Pier . We ca n't wait to go to the Swissotel again !

We went to Chicago to see an exhibit at the Art Institute and selected the Fairmont because it was so close . Although the lobby is still being renovated , our experience at the hotel was uniformly positive . The room was nicely sized and newly remodeled and immaculate . The only glitch involved getting the room coffee replenished . The maid does not do that , and by bedtime on the first night , we still did n't have coffee . We called the front desk and they immediately delivered a fresh supply . The restaurant is a little underwhelming , but with so many other places to go within a very few blocks , we probably would n't have eaten there any more than we did . After having stayed in close to a dozen different Chicago hotels , this may be the hotel we return to whenever we return .

My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum . I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool , one white phone and one emergency red phone , to call the desk . Both were out of service ! ! ! ! I am glad there was n't an emergency . As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean .... never heard back .

The room wasvery tiny and was very warm . They give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do . The bathroom is small . The tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review , and does crackle under your feet . I , personally , did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality . The public areas are nice and are good to hang out in . This is basically an old hotel that has been updated . The comment about the closet is true , it is actually indescriable . You can hear everything occuring in the other rooms . The location is convienent but so are many other hotels . If you do stay , fly into Midway , take the Orange Line , you can not go wrong .

This is a great hotel ! The views are fabulous , the service it friendly and the location is superb . We booked a room on an upper floor and had access to the lounge where breakfast and snacks were available with picture perfect views of the Chicago River . The only negative is that the ceilings in the hall and room are low and can make you feel a little cramped . We booked our room for $ 89 a night for Memorial Day weekend . It was a steal ! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will be returning !

For a short time during vacation I had rented a room from The Ambassador East Hotel , I have to say I was quite impressed with what I experienced and would referre others looking to stay in a hotel to that given location . The hotel is comfortable and spacey with nice staff who are always polite to aid you whenever it is needed , and trust me I am not the nicest person in the world so this says a lot . The food is good , location is great , everything is easily accessible and all the given luxuries of a hotel are well kept here .

The Hotel Allegro located in the Chicago Loop , provided my wife and I with one of the worst hotel experiences in recent memory . We ordered the weekend Liquid Therapy package 48 hours prior as noted on their website , but to our surprise when we arrived , our names were nowhere to be found in their system ! No room , no accommodations at the restaurant , nothing had been prepared for us and apparently another couple had already reserved the last available slot . A weekend away turned into the weekend from hell when we were asked to take a smaller room than I originally booked , and never did they offer us a replacement dining option ! I have a receipt and credit card statement that shows our reservations being made on time . We will never be staying here again .

We got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in Chicago on 7/24/09 . We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $ 69 ( normal rate was around $ 200 ) . The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed . Hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient . Parking is very expensive at $ 50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $ 30 . We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere . We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict . They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we did n't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast . Glad we did n't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better . I highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your Chicago visit .

Advertised as a luxury hotel the Conrad Chicago is more gouge than grand . My wife and I decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in Chicago for our tenth anniversary . After looking at several hotels in the "" Magnificent Mile "" territory of downtown Chicago we selected the Conrad . The Conrad 's website impressed us immediately . The pictures of the rooms were lovely , they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions , not that we were planning to watch much tv . We called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system , I was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who could n't figure out how I was unable to make my reservations via the automated system . In any case I picked the deluxe king - size bed room for two nights in mid September . My wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online , most impressed with the view . It cost a pretty penny , more than I would normally spend on out of town accomidations , but her happiness was worth it . Unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the Conrad . Valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife 's purse when unloading the luggage . We spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it . At the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system . I explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king - sized room but at an additional cost . By the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay . That ended when we found out that our "" view "" was of a back alley service corridor . So much for the skyline . Overall , the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow . I hate to be picky but I was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up . The spa had very limited hours as well . Somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams , away from the hotel . It was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count . I would not recommend the Conrad Chicago . I would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in Chicago . I was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid - range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms , but would n't have cleaned out so much of my wallet .

The Hard Rock Hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several colleagues traveling into Chicago .. The location is fantastic - a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as Lake Michigan , Millennium Park , and Art Museum - and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from . My co - works LOVED the exterior of the building , views from the rooms , the art on the walls , and crisp , clean & hip feeling of the hotel , but not "" too over the top "" for "" business "" . By far a better experience than your usual "" chain "" hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms . Here you feel special ... for the same price . The lobby and bar have fun & cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on Michigan Ave ( or catch a real rock star in the lobby ! )

We booked our room at the Swissotel on Hotwire for $ 88 ( unbelievable rate ! ) and were extremely impressed with the Swissotel . The staff was so polite and catered to our every need . The room was oversized , clean , and had a large bathroom . We had a partial view of Lake Michigan , which was an added bonus . On the 42nd floor , they have a spotless workout room and pool with a view of the city and lake from 3 sides . Spectacular ! We sat in the hot tub and looked down on Navy Pier . We ca n't wait to go to the Swissotel again !

We went to Chicago to see an exhibit at the Art Institute and selected the Fairmont because it was so close . Although the lobby is still being renovated , our experience at the hotel was uniformly positive . The room was nicely sized and newly remodeled and immaculate . The only glitch involved getting the room coffee replenished . The maid does not do that , and by bedtime on the first night , we still did n't have coffee . We called the front desk and they immediately delivered a fresh supply . The restaurant is a little underwhelming , but with so many other places to go within a very few blocks , we probably would n't have eaten there any more than we did . After having stayed in close to a dozen different Chicago hotels , this may be the hotel we return to whenever we return .

The room wasvery tiny and was very warm . They give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do . The bathroom is small . The tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review , and does crackle under your feet . I , personally , did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality . The public areas are nice and are good to hang out in . This is basically an old hotel that has been updated . The comment about the closet is true , it is actually indescriable . You can hear everything occuring in the other rooms . The location is convienent but so are many other hotels . If you do stay , fly into Midway , take the Orange Line , you can not go wrong .

This is a great hotel ! The views are fabulous , the service it friendly and the location is superb . We booked a room on an upper floor and had access to the lounge where breakfast and snacks were available with picture perfect views of the Chicago River . The only negative is that the ceilings in the hall and room are low and can make you feel a little cramped . We booked our room for $ 89 a night for Memorial Day weekend . It was a steal !

No room , no accommodations at the restaurant , nothing had been prepared for us and apparently another couple had already reserved the last available slot .

We got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in Chicago on 7/24/09 . We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $ 69 ( normal rate was around $ 200 ) . The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed . Hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient . Parking is very expensive at $ 50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $ 30 . We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere . We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict . They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we did n't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast . Glad we did n't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better . I highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your Chicago visit .

Advertised as a luxury hotel the Conrad Chicago is more gouge than grand . My wife and I decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in Chicago for our tenth anniversary . After looking at several hotels in the "" Magnificent Mile "" territory of downtown Chicago we selected the Conrad . The Conrad 's website impressed us immediately . The pictures of the rooms were lovely , they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions , not that we were planning to watch much tv . We called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system , I was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who could n't figure out how I was unable to make my reservations via the automated system . In any case I picked the deluxe king - size bed room for two nights in mid September . My wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online , most impressed with the view . It cost a pretty penny , more than I would normally spend on out of town accomidations , but her happiness was worth it . Unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the Conrad . Valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife 's purse when unloading the luggage . We spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it . At the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system . I explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king - sized room but at an additional cost . By the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay . That ended when we found out that our "" view "" was of a back alley service corridor . So much for the skyline . Overall , the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow . I hate to be picky but I was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up . The spa had very limited hours as well . Somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams , away from the hotel . It was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count . I would not recommend the Conrad Chicago . I would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in Chicago . I was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid - range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms , but would n't have cleaned out so much of my wallet .

The Hard Rock Hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several colleagues traveling into Chicago .. The location is fantastic - a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as Lake Michigan , Millennium Park , and Art Museum - and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from . My co - works LOVED the exterior of the building , views from the rooms , the art on the walls , and crisp , clean & hip feeling of the hotel , but not "" too over the top "" for "" business "" . By far a better experience than your usual "" chain "" hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms . Here you feel special ... for the same price . The lobby and bar have fun & cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on Michigan Ave ( or catch a real rock star in the lobby ! )

This is a great find for downtown Chicago. The price is right and the staff are excellent. As noted, there is construction going on around the hotel, but I didn't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping. I asked for a quiet room on an upper floor, and was gladly given one. The lobby is small, the atmosphere is that of a small boutique hotel. The concierge, Stephanie did a super job in finding us a restaurant and booking us reservations (along with a complimentary appetizer). We had a standard room, and it was spacious, tastefully decorated--everything we needed. The bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub for soaking--and the MP3 compatible radio was a nice perk. Just can't say enough about how nice the staff are--every single person you meet. Would definitely stay here again.

Stay away from the Hyatt Regency Chicago. I recently had to spend the weekend in Chicago on business, and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town, but alas, I was left disappointed. I arrived in the afternoon, my flight having been delayed, ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening. Unfortunately, my room was not ready. It should have been ready hours earlier, but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff. In any event, I was advised to wait in the bar, creatively named BIG Bar. They seemed annoyed that I wanted only water, not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that I spent time in their hideously noisy establishment--I wanted only to relax in my room. I waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk. Was my room ready yet? 'What room?' they replied. To my astonishment, it seemed that I no longer had a reservation! How this came to pass, I do not know, and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me. I explained that I was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned, or furnished, or renovated, or whatever they were doing to make it ready, but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer, who spake ""Guest Not Found"" or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters. I requested the manager, who was unavailable, presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either. Finally, I admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel, with fewer regrets than I would have imagined, to find a better place to spend the night--a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point. As it was, I found another hotel, better priced, better staffed, and with rooms ready for my custom. So if you are looking an experience like no other, book a room at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. If you want a place to sleep, look elsewhere.

I arrived here at about 8pm after a flight from California. I didn't know about the renovation when I made the reservations, but that didn't bother me very much. I was helped by a man at the front desk named Ben, who was friendly enough, but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay. He gave me NO information about anything. I had no idea where breakfast was served, or even if there WAS breakfast. There was also an EXTREMELY unpleasant woman working behind the desk(she wasn't wearing a name tag but was African American, slim with short hair) who seemed to be actually radiating hostility. It made me very uncomfortable and needless to say, made me feel unwelcome. I actually felt like I was putting her out by staying in the hotel. I encountered her again the next morning when I had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit, and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness. I also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners. No matter what may be going on in one's life, when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile. I was appalled by her demeanor. My room was alright, there was no clock which I found very odd. Since I came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and I was constantly confused as to which one was correct, especially upon waking up in the morning. It would have been nice to have a clock. There was also no literature on local sites, maps, restaurant menus, or even anything with the hotel's name and address in the room. Also, the mattress was the absolute worst mattress I've ever slept on in my life. I woke up every morning with a sore back and neck. I've had better sleep on a hard, lumpy futon. It was absurd. Like another person posted, my tub did not drain either, and I was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found. Maybe they were around somewhere, but I wasn't made aware of it at check-in, and I didn't want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like I was a burden to the employees. The hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance, but I absolutely would not stay here again. I've had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel, which was a bummer because it was my first visit to Chicago and I had pretty high expectations.

My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad, unfortunately, we would never stay in this hotel again. The rooms looked nice, but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink. The room service cost was super high - costing us over $100 for 1 burger, 1 order of french toast, 2 pops and 2 desserts. In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake. We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room (we were on the 5th floor, same as the reception desk). They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower. The staff was friendly enough, but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems. There was not even a coffee pot in the room. Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price. NOT worth it!

I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago. While higher priced, the reviews online plus four stars convinced me. Granted the hotel itself is beautiful, but looks can be deceiving. The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey. The restaurant (Cafe Des Architect) had amazing food, so that was a plus, but the service was awful. I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water! My remote wouldn't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud. The hotel must've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night. The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently. I called twice for more fresh towels. If I wanted this type of experience, I'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel. Same experience, less money!

everything that i read from other reviews was pretty much on the money, they have excellent customer service, the employees there really cared about their guests, there was always coffee, tea, hot chocolate in the lobby, good hot breakfast and dinner with wine and beer, the doormen were nice and willing to help out for directions, the room did the job, there was a kitchen, 2 flat screen tv's, and a pullout couch included, it was close to the ""eL"", but for us we found the buses to be more useful. I would recommend getting a pass, we got a 3 day pass and it was well worth it for $14 which we got at jewel osco, not too far from the hotel, for the most part the majority of the people that were there were older people on a business trip and families, but us three girls didn't mind, so i would definitely recommend this place, it was one of the cheapest places were found out of all the other hotels.

The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well. The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all.

Stay away from the Hyatt Regency Chicago . I recently had to spend the weekend in Chicago on business , and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town , but alas , I was left disappointed . I arrived in the afternoon , my flight having been delayed , ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening . Unfortunately , my room was not ready . It should have been ready hours earlier , but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff . In any event , I was advised to wait in the bar , creatively named BIG Bar . They seemed annoyed that I wanted only water , not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that I spent time in their hideously noisy establishment -- I wanted only to relax in my room . I waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk . Was my room ready yet ? ' What room ? ' they replied . To my astonishment , it seemed that I no longer had a reservation ! How this came to pass , I do not know , and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me . I explained that I was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned , or furnished , or renovated , or whatever they were doing to make it ready , but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer , who spake "" Guest Not Found "" or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters . I requested the manager , who was unavailable , presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either . Finally , I admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel , with fewer regrets than I would have imagined , to find a better place to spend the night -- a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point . As it was , I found another hotel , better priced , better staffed , and with rooms ready for my custom . So if you are looking an experience like no other , book a room at the Hyatt Regency Chicago . If you want a place to sleep , look elsewhere .

I arrived here at about 8 pm after a flight from California . I did n't know about the renovation when I made the reservations , but that did n't bother me very much . I was helped by a man at the front desk named Ben , who was friendly enough , but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay . He gave me NO information about anything . I had no idea where breakfast was served , or even if there WAS breakfast . There was also an EXTREMELY unpleasant woman working behind the desk(she was n't wearing a name tag but was African American , slim with short hair ) who seemed to be actually radiating hostility . It made me very uncomfortable and needless to say , made me feel unwelcome . I actually felt like I was putting her out by staying in the hotel . I encountered her again the next morning when I had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit , and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness . I also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners . No matter what may be going on in one 's life , when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile . I was appalled by her demeanor . My room was alright , there was no clock which I found very odd . Since I came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and I was constantly confused as to which one was correct , especially upon waking up in the morning . It would have been nice to have a clock . There was also no literature on local sites , maps , restaurant menus , or even anything with the hotel 's name and address in the room . Also , the mattress was the absolute worst mattress I 've ever slept on in my life . I woke up every morning with a sore back and neck . I 've had better sleep on a hard , lumpy futon . It was absurd . Like another person posted , my tub did not drain either , and I was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found . Maybe they were around somewhere , but I was n't made aware of it at check - in , and I did n't want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like I was a burden to the employees . The hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance , but I absolutely would not stay here again . I 've had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel , which was a bummer because it was my first visit to Chicago and I had pretty high expectations .

My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad , unfortunately , we would never stay in this hotel again . The rooms looked nice , but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink . The room service cost was super high - costing us over $ 100 for 1 burger , 1 order of french toast , 2 pops and 2 desserts . In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake . We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room ( we were on the 5th floor , same as the reception desk ) . They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower . The staff was friendly enough , but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems . There was not even a coffee pot in the room . Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price . NOT worth it !

I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago . While higher priced , the reviews online plus four stars convinced me . Granted the hotel itself is beautiful , but looks can be deceiving . The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey . The restaurant ( Cafe Des Architect ) had amazing food , so that was a plus , but the service was awful . I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water ! My remote would n't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud . The hotel must 've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night . The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently . I called twice for more fresh towels . If I wanted this type of experience , I 'd have stayed at a lower - end hotel . Same experience , less money !

The location of this hotel was superb ! Our room was spacious and the view was spectacular . The staff at the hotel treated my family with the upmost respect . One of the front desk staff even helped my five year old tie his shoes while we were waiting for the porter . We will stay here again and advise our friends to do the same .

everything that i read from other reviews was pretty much on the money , they have excellent customer service , the employees there really cared about their guests , there was always coffee , tea , hot chocolate in the lobby , good hot breakfast and dinner with wine and beer , the doormen were nice and willing to help out for directions , the room did the job , there was a kitchen , 2 flat screen tv 's , and a pullout couch included , it was close to the "" eL "" , but for us we found the buses to be more useful . I would recommend getting a pass , we got a 3 day pass and it was well worth it for $ 14 which we got at jewel osco , not too far from the hotel , for the most part the majority of the people that were there were older people on a business trip and families , but us three girls did n't mind , so i would definitely recommend this place , it was one of the cheapest places were found out of all the other hotels .

Me and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital . We ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here . At first once coming into the room , there was a mildewy smell in the air , which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase . The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well . The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all . To make matters even worse , the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon , when my wife was back from exploring the city . This was simply unacceptable by any standard .

I actually booked this reservation with the hotel over the phone and got a great rate -- much lower than the usual price ! It was a lovely hotel , beautifully appointed , walking distance from the places we wanted to go . We would highly recommend the Fairmont .

This is a great find for downtown Chicago . The price is right and the staff are excellent . As noted , there is construction going on around the hotel , but I did n't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping . I asked for a quiet room on an upper floor , and was gladly given one . The lobby is small , the atmosphere is that of a small boutique hotel . The concierge , Stephanie did a super job in finding us a restaurant and booking us reservations ( along with a complimentary appetizer ) . We had a standard room , and it was spacious , tastefully decorated -- everything we needed . The bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub for soaking -- and the MP3 compatible radio was a nice perk . Just ca n't say enough about how nice the staff are -- every single person you meet . Would definitely stay here again .

Stay away from the Hyatt Regency Chicago . I recently had to spend the weekend in Chicago on business , and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town , but alas , I was left disappointed . I arrived in the afternoon , my flight having been delayed , ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening . Unfortunately , my room was not ready . It should have been ready hours earlier , but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff . In any event , I was advised to wait in the bar , creatively named BIG Bar . They seemed annoyed that I wanted only water , not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that I spent time in their hideously noisy establishment -- I wanted only to relax in my room . I waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk . Was my room ready yet ? ' What room ? ' they replied . To my astonishment , it seemed that I no longer had a reservation ! How this came to pass , I do not know , and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me . I explained that I was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned , or furnished , or renovated , or whatever they were doing to make it ready , but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer , who spake "" Guest Not Found "" or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters . I requested the manager , who was unavailable , presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either . Finally , I admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel , with fewer regrets than I would have imagined , to find a better place to spend the night -- a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point . As it was , I found another hotel , better priced , better staffed , and with rooms ready for my custom . So if you are looking an experience like no other , book a room at the Hyatt Regency Chicago . If you want a place to sleep , look elsewhere .

I arrived here at about 8 pm after a flight from California . I did n't know about the renovation when I made the reservations , but that did n't bother me very much . I was helped by a man at the front desk named Ben , who was friendly enough , but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay . He gave me NO information about anything . I had no idea where breakfast was served , or even if there WAS breakfast . There was also an EXTREMELY unpleasant woman working behind the desk(she was n't wearing a name tag but was African American , slim with short hair ) who seemed to be actually radiating hostility . It made me very uncomfortable and needless to say , made me feel unwelcome . I actually felt like I was putting her out by staying in the hotel . I encountered her again the next morning when I had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit , and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness . I also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners . No matter what may be going on in one 's life , when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile . I was appalled by her demeanor . My room was alright , there was no clock which I found very odd . Since I came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and I was constantly confused as to which one was correct , especially upon waking up in the morning . It would have been nice to have a clock . There was also no literature on local sites , maps , restaurant menus , or even anything with the hotel 's name and address in the room . Also , the mattress was the absolute worst mattress I 've ever slept on in my life . I woke up every morning with a sore back and neck . I 've had better sleep on a hard , lumpy futon . It was absurd . Like another person posted , my tub did not drain either , and I was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found . Maybe they were around somewhere , but I was n't made aware of it at check - in , and I did n't want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like I was a burden to the employees . The hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance , but I absolutely would not stay here again . I 've had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel , which was a bummer because it was my first visit to Chicago and I had pretty high expectations .

My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad , unfortunately , we would never stay in this hotel again . The rooms looked nice , but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink . The room service cost was super high - costing us over $ 100 for 1 burger , 1 order of french toast , 2 pops and 2 desserts . In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake . We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room ( we were on the 5th floor , same as the reception desk ) . They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower . The staff was friendly enough , but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems . There was not even a coffee pot in the room . Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price . NOT worth it !

I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago . While higher priced , the reviews online plus four stars convinced me . Granted the hotel itself is beautiful , but looks can be deceiving . The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey . The restaurant ( Cafe Des Architect ) had amazing food , so that was a plus , but the service was awful . I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water ! My remote would n't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud . The hotel must 've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night . The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently . I called twice for more fresh towels . If I wanted this type of experience , I 'd have stayed at a lower - end hotel . Same experience , less money !

The location of this hotel was superb ! Our room was spacious and the view was spectacular . The staff at the hotel treated my family with the upmost respect . One of the front desk staff even helped my five year old tie his shoes while we were waiting for the porter . We will stay here again and advise our friends to do the same .

everything that i read from other reviews was pretty much on the money , they have excellent customer service , the employees there really cared about their guests , there was always coffee , tea , hot chocolate in the lobby , good hot breakfast and dinner with wine and beer , the doormen were nice and willing to help out for directions , the room did the job , there was a kitchen , 2 flat screen tv 's , and a pullout couch included , it was close to the "" eL "" , but for us we found the buses to be more useful . I would recommend getting a pass , we got a 3 day pass and it was well worth it for $ 14 which we got at jewel osco , not too far from the hotel , for the most part the majority of the people that were there were older people on a business trip and families , but us three girls did n't mind , so i would definitely recommend this place , it was one of the cheapest places were found out of all the other hotels .

Me and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital . We ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here . At first once coming into the room , there was a mildewy smell in the air , which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase . The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well . The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all . To make matters even worse , the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon , when my wife was back from exploring the city . This was simply unacceptable by any standard .

This is a great find for downtown Chicago . The price is right and the staff are excellent . As noted , there is construction going on around the hotel , but I did n't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping . I asked for a quiet room on an upper floor , and was gladly given one . The lobby is small , the atmosphere is that of a small boutique hotel . The concierge , Stephanie did a super job in finding us a restaurant and booking us reservations ( along with a complimentary appetizer ) . We had a standard room , and it was spacious , tastefully decorated -- everything we needed . The bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub for soaking -- and the MP3 compatible radio was a nice perk . Just ca n't say enough about how nice the staff are -- every single person you meet . Would definitely stay here again .

Stay away from the Hyatt Regency Chicago . I recently had to spend the weekend in Chicago on business , and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town , but alas , I was left disappointed . I arrived in the afternoon , my flight having been delayed , ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening . Unfortunately , my room was not ready . It should have been ready hours earlier , but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff . In any event , I was advised to wait in the bar , creatively named BIG Bar . They seemed annoyed that I wanted only water , not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that I spent time in their hideously noisy establishment -- I wanted only to relax in my room . I waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk . Was my room ready yet ? ' What room ? ' they replied . To my astonishment , it seemed that I no longer had a reservation ! How this came to pass , I do not know , and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me . I explained that I was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned , or furnished , or renovated , or whatever they were doing to make it ready , but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer , who spake "" Guest Not Found "" or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters . I requested the manager , who was unavailable , presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either . Finally , I admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel , with fewer regrets than I would have imagined , to find a better place to spend the night -- a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point . As it was , I found another hotel , better priced , better staffed , and with rooms ready for my custom . So if you are looking an experience like no other , book a room at the Hyatt Regency Chicago . If you want a place to sleep , look elsewhere .

I arrived here at about 8 pm after a flight from California . I did n't know about the renovation when I made the reservations , but that did n't bother me very much . I was helped by a man at the front desk named Ben , who was friendly enough , but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay . He gave me NO information about anything . I had no idea where breakfast was served , or even if there WAS breakfast . There was also an EXTREMELY unpleasant woman working behind the desk(she was n't wearing a name tag but was African American , slim with short hair ) who seemed to be actually radiating hostility . It made me very uncomfortable and needless to say , made me feel unwelcome . I actually felt like I was putting her out by staying in the hotel . I encountered her again the next morning when I had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit , and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness . I also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners . No matter what may be going on in one 's life , when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile . I was appalled by her demeanor . My room was alright , there was no clock which I found very odd . Since I came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and I was constantly confused as to which one was correct , especially upon waking up in the morning . It would have been nice to have a clock . There was also no literature on local sites , maps , restaurant menus , or even anything with the hotel 's name and address in the room . Also , the mattress was the absolute worst mattress I 've ever slept on in my life . I woke up every morning with a sore back and neck . I 've had better sleep on a hard , lumpy futon . It was absurd . Like another person posted , my tub did not drain either , and I was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found . Maybe they were around somewhere , but I was n't made aware of it at check - in , and I did n't want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like I was a burden to the employees . The hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance , but I absolutely would not stay here again . I 've had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel , which was a bummer because it was my first visit to Chicago and I had pretty high expectations .

My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad , unfortunately , we would never stay in this hotel again . The rooms looked nice , but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink . The room service cost was super high - costing us over $ 100 for 1 burger , 1 order of french toast , 2 pops and 2 desserts . In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake . We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room ( we were on the 5th floor , same as the reception desk ) . They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower . The staff was friendly enough , but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems . There was not even a coffee pot in the room . Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price . NOT worth it !

I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago . While higher priced , the reviews online plus four stars convinced me . Granted the hotel itself is beautiful , but looks can be deceiving . The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey . The restaurant ( Cafe Des Architect ) had amazing food , so that was a plus , but the service was awful . I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water ! My remote would n't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud . The hotel must 've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night . The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently . I called twice for more fresh towels . If I wanted this type of experience , I 'd have stayed at a lower - end hotel .

everything that i read from other reviews was pretty much on the money , they have excellent customer service , the employees there really cared about their guests , there was always coffee , tea , hot chocolate in the lobby , good hot breakfast and dinner with wine and beer , the doormen were nice and willing to help out for directions , the room did the job , there was a kitchen , 2 flat screen tv 's , and a pullout couch included , it was close to the "" eL "" , but for us we found the buses to be more useful . I would recommend getting a pass , we got a 3 day pass and it was well worth it for $ 14 which we got at jewel osco , not too far from the hotel , for the most part the majority of the people that were there were older people on a business trip and families , but us three girls did n't mind , so i would definitely recommend this place , it was one of the cheapest places were found out of all the other hotels .

The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well . The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all .

went to chicago for a week in may, decided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton, we were not disapointed. perhaps it was becuse there were quite a few conventions going on and a lot of people were only staying 1 or 2 nights but we got upgraged to exceutive level. we had 2 double beds with a bathroom each. they beds and pillows were too die for, so so comfy ant the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles. all the staff were very helpful. a lot of guests seemed to ignore the staff especially the chamber maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps that why some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful. about 2 blocks away on Harrison is a cafe called ""Orange"" which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast, the cafe and the staff are suberb. expect a 15 min wait on a sat & sun morning.

when i first checked the hotel's website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there. but i was totally disappointed once i got there, first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor , and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one, it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that. then when i was trying to enjoy the view, they windows were all dusty and dirty. so i decided to get out of the room , and i went to the pool and it wasnt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture . so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse!. i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable; the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww!, its all i can say about this hotel.

After considering several hotels in the area, my family and I finally decided, unfortunately, on Homewood Suites, for our long weekend vacation. Overall, the experience left much to be desired.

went to chicago for a week in may, decided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton, we were not disapointed. perhaps it was becuse there were quite a few conventions going on and a lot of people were only staying 1 or 2 nights but we got upgraged to exceutive level. we had 2 double beds with a bathroom each. they beds and pillows were too die for, so so comfy ant the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles. all the staff were very helpful. a lot of guests seemed to ignore the staff especially the chamber maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps that why some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful. about 2 blocks away on Harrison is a cafe called ""Orange"" which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast, the cafe and the staff are suberb. expect a 15 min wait on a sat & sun morning.

We have stayed at several high end places in Chicago and this is still our favorite. Location is superb, staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being cloying. Cornell, at the front desk, is unfailingly helpful as is the concierge. We love the extra room that a suite provides and if you join the frequent guest program, high speed internet is gratis, as is a breakfast beverage delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing. Bedding is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing blackout curtains! We have never had a bad stay at this hotel.

We had our hotel reservations at another hotel set and after we were reading all of the negative reviews we cancelled and made out reservation at the Hilton - I am so glad we did the hotel was clean, hotel staff was pleasant and helpful and the beds were amazing. We knew we were paying a little more than some other hotels but it was well worth every penny.

when i first checked the hotel's website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there. but i was totally disappointed once i got there, first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor , and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one, it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that. then when i was trying to enjoy the view, they windows were all dusty and dirty. so i decided to get out of the room , and i went to the pool and it wasnt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture . so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse!. i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable; the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww!, its all i can say about this hotel.

After considering several hotels in the area, my family and I finally decided, unfortunately, on Homewood Suites, for our long weekend vacation. Overall, the experience left much to be desired. The breakfast buffet consisted of cold scrambled eggs and greasy pastries. The linens on one of our beds seemed dirty, and when I told the hotel staff and asked them to be replaced, the woman rolled her eyes and had a very unprofessional attitude. I would not come back here ever.

Great place, great room, great location. Even though there was a big meeting going on (Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns) the only consequence for us was slow elevators. Ballroom is amazing, shops on ground floor a nice throwback. Lake views from upper floors -- we were on 17 I think -- are worth it. Concierge advice about restaurants etc was excellent. Definitly would return.

My stay at the Talbott was a wonderful experience . The service at this upscale hotel was beyond my expectations , the Gold Coast location is close to Michigan Ave , the museums , and many of the other sites Chicago has to offer . If you are visiting Chicago , I highly recommend the Talbott !

Did not enjoy my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel . Firstly , the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful . There was a problem with the reservation and he gave me and my family a lot of hassle . Secondly when we finally got the reservation sorted out , the air conditioning unit in our room would not go below 75 degrees . Considering I paid well over $ 250 per night for the Romance package reservation , it was below my standards and I will not be heading back to the Omni Chicago Hotel any time soon .

When I had to visit Chicago for business I asked some of my associates where to stay and several of them recommended the Hotel Allegro . After my stay I can honestly say that I agree . From the luxurious bedding to the technological amenities , everything was thought of . The only place I find more comfortable then this hotel is my actual home . I now know where I will be staying every time I have business in this city , and anyone I know who is doing the same will hear so .

The hotel is just ok . Stayed there for 5 days when visiting friends . They had a renovation going so there was no lobby , bar or anything . Just a decently furnished room for 200 usd . The renovation was not annoying but i think they ahould charge ... much less untill its done . You ca nt beat the location ! Very convenient especially if u like chicqgo nightlife !

went to chicago for a week in may , decided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton , we were not disapointed . perhaps it was becuse there were quite a few conventions going on and a lot of people were only staying 1 or 2 nights but we got upgraged to exceutive level . we had 2 double beds with a bathroom each . they beds and pillows were too die for , so so comfy ant the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles . all the staff were very helpful . a lot of guests seemed to ignore the staff especially the chamber maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps that why some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful . about 2 blocks away on Harrison is a cafe called "" Orange "" which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast , the cafe and the staff are suberb . expect a 15 min wait on a sat & sun morning .

We have stayed at several high end places in Chicago and this is still our favorite . Location is superb , staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being cloying . Cornell , at the front desk , is unfailingly helpful as is the concierge . We love the extra room that a suite provides and if you join the frequent guest program , high speed internet is gratis , as is a breakfast beverage delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing . Bedding is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing blackout curtains ! We have never had a bad stay at this hotel .

We had our hotel reservations at another hotel set and after we were reading all of the negative reviews we cancelled and made out reservation at the Hilton - I am so glad we did the hotel was clean , hotel staff was pleasant and helpful and the beds were amazing . We knew we were paying a little more than some other hotels but it was well worth every penny .

when i first checked the hotel 's website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there . but i was totally disappointed once i got there , first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor , and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one , it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that . then when i was trying to enjoy the view , they windows were all dusty and dirty . so i decided to get out of the room , and i went to the pool and it was nt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture . so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse!. i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable ; the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww ! , its all i can say about this hotel .

After considering several hotels in the area , my family and I finally decided , unfortunately , on Homewood Suites , for our long weekend vacation . Overall , the experience left much to be desired . The breakfast buffet consisted of cold scrambled eggs and greasy pastries . The linens on one of our beds seemed dirty , and when I told the hotel staff and asked them to be replaced , the woman rolled her eyes and had a very unprofessional attitude . I would not come back here ever .

Great place , great room , great location . Even though there was a big meeting going on ( Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns ) the only consequence for us was slow elevators . Ballroom is amazing , shops on ground floor a nice throwback . Lake views from upper floors -- we were on 17 I think -- are worth it . Concierge advice about restaurants etc was excellent . Definitly would return .

My stay at the Talbott was a wonderful experience . The service at this upscale hotel was beyond my expectations , the Gold Coast location is close to Michigan Ave , the museums , and many of the other sites Chicago has to offer . If you are visiting Chicago , I highly recommend the Talbott !

Did not enjoy my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel . Firstly , the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful . There was a problem with the reservation and he gave me and my family a lot of hassle . Secondly when we finally got the reservation sorted out , the air conditioning unit in our room would not go below 75 degrees . Considering I paid well over $ 250 per night for the Romance package reservation , it was below my standards and I will not be heading back to the Omni Chicago Hotel any time soon .

When I had to visit Chicago for business I asked some of my associates where to stay and several of them recommended the Hotel Allegro . After my stay I can honestly say that I agree . From the luxurious bedding to the technological amenities , everything was thought of . The only place I find more comfortable then this hotel is my actual home . I now know where I will be staying every time I have business in this city , and anyone I know who is doing the same will hear so .

The hotel is just ok . Stayed there for 5 days when visiting friends . They had a renovation going so there was no lobby , bar or anything . Just a decently furnished room for 200 usd .

went to chicago for a week in may , decided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton , we were not disapointed . perhaps it was becuse there were quite a few conventions going on and a lot of people were only staying 1 or 2 nights but we got upgraged to exceutive level . we had 2 double beds with a bathroom each . they beds and pillows were too die for , so so comfy ant the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles . all the staff were very helpful . a lot of guests seemed to ignore the staff especially the chamber maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps that why some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful . about 2 blocks away on Harrison is a cafe called "" Orange "" which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast , the cafe and the staff are suberb . expect a 15 min wait on a sat & sun morning .

We have stayed at several high end places in Chicago and this is still our favorite . Location is superb , staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being cloying . Cornell , at the front desk , is unfailingly helpful as is the concierge . We love the extra room that a suite provides and if you join the frequent guest program , high speed internet is gratis , as is a breakfast beverage delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing . Bedding is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing blackout curtains ! We have never had a bad stay at this hotel .

We had our hotel reservations at another hotel set and after we were reading all of the negative reviews we cancelled and made out reservation at the Hilton - I am so glad we did the hotel was clean , hotel staff was pleasant and helpful and the beds were amazing . We knew we were paying a little more than some other hotels but it was well worth every penny .

when i first checked the hotel 's website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there . but i was totally disappointed once i got there , first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor , and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one , it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that . then when i was trying to enjoy the view , they windows were all dusty and dirty . so i decided to get out of the room , and i went to the pool and it was nt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture . so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse!. i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable ; the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww ! , its all i can say about this hotel .

After considering several hotels in the area , my family and I finally decided , unfortunately , on Homewood Suites , for our long weekend vacation . Overall , the experience left much to be desired . The breakfast buffet consisted of cold scrambled eggs and greasy pastries . The linens on one of our beds seemed dirty , and when I told the hotel staff and asked them to be replaced , the woman rolled her eyes and had a very unprofessional attitude . I would not come back here ever .

Great place , great room , great location . Even though there was a big meeting going on ( Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns ) the only consequence for us was slow elevators . Ballroom is amazing , shops on ground floor a nice throwback . Lake views from upper floors -- we were on 17 I think -- are worth it . Concierge advice about restaurants etc was excellent . Definitly would return .

My stay at the Talbott was a wonderful experience . The service at this upscale hotel was beyond my expectations , the Gold Coast location is close to Michigan Ave , the museums , and many of the other sites Chicago has to offer . If you are visiting Chicago , I highly recommend the Talbott !

Did not enjoy my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel . Firstly , the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful . There was a problem with the reservation and he gave me and my family a lot of hassle . Secondly when we finally got the reservation sorted out , the air conditioning unit in our room would not go below 75 degrees . Considering I paid well over $ 250 per night for the Romance package reservation , it was below my standards and I will not be heading back to the Omni Chicago Hotel any time soon .

went to chicago for a week in may , decided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton , we were not disapointed . perhaps it was becuse there were quite a few conventions going on and a lot of people were only staying 1 or 2 nights but we got upgraged to exceutive level . we had 2 double beds with a bathroom each . they beds and pillows were too die for , so so comfy ant the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles . all the staff were very helpful . a lot of guests seemed to ignore the staff especially the chamber maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps that why some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful . about 2 blocks away on Harrison is a cafe called "" Orange "" which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast , the cafe and the staff are suberb . expect a 15 min wait on a sat & sun morning .

when i first checked the hotel 's website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there . but i was totally disappointed once i got there , first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor , and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one , it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that . then when i was trying to enjoy the view , they windows were all dusty and dirty . so i decided to get out of the room , and i went to the pool and it was nt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture . so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse!. i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable ; the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww ! , its all i can say about this hotel .

The room was clean and stylish, and the staff was very courteous from check-in to check-out. My favorite part was the amazing bathroom - way better than mine at home. I definitely had a great escape that weekend and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to relax.

So...the location to the Clark/Lake train stop is great...and that is the only thing that is great with the hotel. The wall are very thin...so much you can hear giggling and early morning housekeeping conversations in the hallway. There is no coffee maker in the room, however; free coffee is available in the lobby...becuase everyone wants to go to the lobby first thing in the morning??? Finally, the ""business center"" is a pay for use set-up...no courtesty internet usage or printing. Lastly...they bathroom is micro-tiny and lacks in counterspace and comfort.

We stayed in the Conrad for 4 nights just before Thanksgiving. We had a corner room overlooking N Michigan Av and the Tribune Building. To say this is a 5 star hotel is to damn this place with faint praise - it is wonderful. The staff were unbelievably helpful. The standard of the room was superb - HD plasma screens, luxury bedlinens, iPod radio, huge bathroom. Location is unbeatable - right in the heart of everything - watched the whole Light Festival parade from the window. Breakfasts were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service. Would have no hesitation recommending or staying again in this hotel - 5 out of 5.

I can only confirm the positve reviews previously mentioned. We stayed in room 1112, King with River View. No noise and very comfortable.The price was a bargain at $191 a night. I would stay here again. The ""L"" from Midway Airport lets you off about two blocks from the Hotel. It's a $2 ride - no need for a $40 taxi ride.

I booked this hotel with great expectations. I had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago. Upon arriving to the hotel (at the exact time I indicated in my reservation) I was told I've been ""downgraded"" to a lesser quality room. I travel very often and never had this before. Moreover, I did not hear a single ""I'm sorry"", it was like usual business. What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me ""I will decrease the rate for you"" ""what do you think, nice eh?"" like he was doing me a favor!!!! They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course (which is the legal thing to do, since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money). They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value. I did not know what to say, since this never happened to me before, also with family present did not want to start arguing. The rooms were nice (not as nice as I thought) and location is good, however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this. That is enough for me not to go back again.

DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!! I would have certainly expected more from the Hilton, especially due to the price I paid for my room and the way the hotel is portrayed. Upon arriving at the hotel I found only one receptionist working and she was too busy texting on her mobile phone to check me in! I had to wait 15 mins before checking in and she made me feel like I was inconveniencing her! When I finally got into my room I was appalled. I had a non smoking reservation and the room stank of smoke and there were several visible cigarette burns in the comforter and the carpet. I called down to reception and to confirm that I was in a non smoking room, which I was advised that I was. I had to argue with the receptionist over the room for 10 mins before she agreed to switch my room for another one. One I entered my new room, I found that once again it stank of smoke, but after being too exhausted from my flight I decided that I would sort it out with reception in the morning. BAD IDEA! I curled up and went to sleep and awoke to the go to the bathroom around 2am where I noticed my legs were COVERED in red welts! I immediately rushed back into the bedroom and through back the covers to find my bed teaming with bed bugs. I packed my stuff and checked out that night, however a refund was refused. I have since contacted the head office and I am awaiting a response. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!

The Palmer House Hilton in Chicago is by far the best experience I have ever had away from home. From the moment you walk into the elegantly appointed lobby, you will never want to leave. The multiple ballrooms, board rooms and private dining rooms make this the perfect site for weddings or business events. If you're looking for leisure activities, there are two bars, the Lockwood Wine Cellar, and an indoor pool. The staff is professional, friendly and helpful. Room service is excellent, and the hotel is conveniently placed to several major attractions in the city.

My first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews. For some reason, I kept being disappointed at every turn. Noisy room on the 4th floor. Could not get the room to cool down - it was stifling. BE WARNED - No water, no mini-bar no vending machine, no nothing once you get in your room. You might as well be in prison. They have coffee in the morning, but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days. I guess that is convenient for them, but what about me? Workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest. The only treadmill I could get on was broken. Guess what a cooler with water in it! Oh no - it was only stocked for one day. After that nothing. Way to set expectations and then fail to deliver. Same with towels - one day they have them - next day they don't. They essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $10 charge for wireless (go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free). They should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach. I have stayed at much better for less. Won't be coming back.

What was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in Chicago turned into a complete disaster. The first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of 6 was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit in...they knew we had 6! We ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel. When we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on 3 different floors despite our request for rooms near each other. After some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor, unfortunately one of the rooms hadn't even been cleaned which meant more waiting around. The staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating. On our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 5:30am. Despite my calls to the front desk, the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes. We also didn't know the hotel was sooo pet friendly. One morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door. I understand they allow pets, but really...people need to clean up after their animals...or have some dog free floors. While Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms, their service was terrible, the staff was rude, and I still can't get over that dog poo in the hallway. I definitely won't be staying here again.

We stayed in the Conrad for 4 nights just before Thanksgiving . We had a corner room overlooking N Michigan Av and the Tribune Building . To say this is a 5 star hotel is to damn this place with faint praise - it is wonderful . The staff were unbelievably helpful . The standard of the room was superb - HD plasma screens , luxury bedlinens , iPod radio , huge bathroom . Location is unbeatable - right in the heart of everything - watched the whole Light Festival parade from the window . Breakfasts were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service . Would have no hesitation recommending or staying again in this hotel - 5 out of 5 .

I can only confirm the positve reviews previously mentioned . We stayed in room 1112 , King with River View . No noise and very comfortable . The price was a bargain at $ 191 a night . I would stay here again . The "" L "" from Midway Airport lets you off about two blocks from the Hotel . It 's a $ 2 ride - no need for a $ 40 taxi ride .

I booked this hotel with great expectations . I had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago . Upon arriving to the hotel ( at the exact time I indicated in my reservation ) I was told I 've been "" downgraded "" to a lesser quality room . I travel very often and never had this before . Moreover , I did not hear a single "" I 'm sorry "" , it was like usual business . What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me "" I will decrease the rate for you "" "" what do you think , nice eh ? "" like he was doing me a favor ! ! ! ! They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course ( which is the legal thing to do , since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money ) . They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value . I did not know what to say , since this never happened to me before , also with family present did not want to start arguing . The rooms were nice ( not as nice as I thought ) and location is good , however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this . That is enough for me not to go back again .

DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL ! ! ! ! I would have certainly expected more from the Hilton , especially due to the price I paid for my room and the way the hotel is portrayed . Upon arriving at the hotel I found only one receptionist working and she was too busy texting on her mobile phone to check me in ! I had to wait 15 mins before checking in and she made me feel like I was inconveniencing her ! When I finally got into my room I was appalled . I had a non smoking reservation and the room stank of smoke and there were several visible cigarette burns in the comforter and the carpet . I called down to reception and to confirm that I was in a non smoking room , which I was advised that I was . I had to argue with the receptionist over the room for 10 mins before she agreed to switch my room for another one . One I entered my new room , I found that once again it stank of smoke , but after being too exhausted from my flight I decided that I would sort it out with reception in the morning . BAD IDEA ! I curled up and went to sleep and awoke to the go to the bathroom around 2 am where I noticed my legs were COVERED in red welts ! I immediately rushed back into the bedroom and through back the covers to find my bed teaming with bed bugs . I packed my stuff and checked out that night , however a refund was refused . I have since contacted the head office and I am awaiting a response . DO NOT STAY HERE ! ! !

The Palmer House Hilton in Chicago is by far the best experience I have ever had away from home . From the moment you walk into the elegantly appointed lobby , you will never want to leave . The multiple ballrooms , board rooms and private dining rooms make this the perfect site for weddings or business events . If you 're looking for leisure activities , there are two bars , the Lockwood Wine Cellar , and an indoor pool . The staff is professional , friendly and helpful . Room service is excellent , and the hotel is conveniently placed to several major attractions in the city .

My first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews . For some reason , I kept being disappointed at every turn . Noisy room on the 4th floor . Could not get the room to cool down - it was stifling . BE WARNED - No water , no mini - bar no vending machine , no nothing once you get in your room . You might as well be in prison . They have coffee in the morning , but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days . I guess that is convenient for them , but what about me ? Workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest . The only treadmill I could get on was broken . Guess what a cooler with water in it ! Oh no - it was only stocked for one day . After that nothing . Way to set expectations and then fail to deliver . Same with towels - one day they have them - next day they do n't . They essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $ 10 charge for wireless ( go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free ) . They should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach . I have stayed at much better for less . Wo n't be coming back .

What was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in Chicago turned into a complete disaster . The first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of 6 was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit in ... they knew we had 6 ! We ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel . When we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on 3 different floors despite our request for rooms near each other . After some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor , unfortunately one of the rooms had n't even been cleaned which meant more waiting around . The staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating . On our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 5:30am . Despite my calls to the front desk , the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes . We also did n't know the hotel was sooo pet friendly . One morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door . I understand they allow pets , but really ... people need to clean up after their animals ... or have some dog free floors . While Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms , their service was terrible , the staff was rude , and I still ca n't get over that dog poo in the hallway . I definitely wo n't be staying here again .

I stayed here in the last weekend of September 2010 for the Bears vs Packers Monday Night game . My room rocked ! I had a pretty big flat screen , and a super soft bed . The room was clean and stylish , and the staff was very courteous from check - in to check - out . My favorite part was the amazing bathroom - way better than mine at home . I definitely had a great escape that weekend and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to relax .

So ... the location to the Clark / Lake train stop is great ... and that is the only thing that is great with the hotel . The wall are very thin ... so much you can hear giggling and early morning housekeeping conversations in the hallway . There is no coffee maker in the room , however ; free coffee is available in the lobby ... becuase everyone wants to go to the lobby first thing in the morning ? ? ? Finally , the "" business center "" is a pay for use set - up ... no courtesty internet usage or printing . Lastly ... they bathroom is micro - tiny and lacks in counterspace and comfort .

We stayed in the Conrad for 4 nights just before Thanksgiving . We had a corner room overlooking N Michigan Av and the Tribune Building . To say this is a 5 star hotel is to damn this place with faint praise - it is wonderful . The staff were unbelievably helpful . The standard of the room was superb - HD plasma screens , luxury bedlinens , iPod radio , huge bathroom . Location is unbeatable - right in the heart of everything - watched the whole Light Festival parade from the window . Breakfasts were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service . Would have no hesitation recommending or staying again in this hotel - 5 out of 5 .

I can only confirm the positve reviews previously mentioned . We stayed in room 1112 , King with River View . No noise and very comfortable . The price was a bargain at $ 191 a night . I would stay here again . The "" L "" from Midway Airport lets you off about two blocks from the Hotel . It 's a $ 2 ride - no need for a $ 40 taxi ride .

I booked this hotel with great expectations . I had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago . Upon arriving to the hotel ( at the exact time I indicated in my reservation ) I was told I 've been "" downgraded "" to a lesser quality room . I travel very often and never had this before . Moreover , I did not hear a single "" I 'm sorry "" , it was like usual business . What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me "" I will decrease the rate for you "" "" what do you think , nice eh ? "" like he was doing me a favor ! ! ! ! They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course ( which is the legal thing to do , since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money ) . They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value . I did not know what to say , since this never happened to me before , also with family present did not want to start arguing . The rooms were nice ( not as nice as I thought ) and location is good , however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this . That is enough for me not to go back again .

DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL ! ! ! ! I would have certainly expected more from the Hilton , especially due to the price I paid for my room and the way the hotel is portrayed . Upon arriving at the hotel I found only one receptionist working and she was too busy texting on her mobile phone to check me in ! I had to wait 15 mins before checking in and she made me feel like I was inconveniencing her ! When I finally got into my room I was appalled . I had a non smoking reservation and the room stank of smoke and there were several visible cigarette burns in the comforter and the carpet . I called down to reception and to confirm that I was in a non smoking room , which I was advised that I was . I had to argue with the receptionist over the room for 10 mins before she agreed to switch my room for another one . One I entered my new room , I found that once again it stank of smoke , but after being too exhausted from my flight I decided that I would sort it out with reception in the morning . BAD IDEA ! I curled up and went to sleep and awoke to the go to the bathroom around 2 am where I noticed my legs were COVERED in red welts ! I immediately rushed back into the bedroom and through back the covers to find my bed teaming with bed bugs . I packed my stuff and checked out that night , however a refund was refused . I have since contacted the head office and I am awaiting a response . DO NOT STAY HERE ! ! !

The Palmer House Hilton in Chicago is by far the best experience I have ever had away from home . From the moment you walk into the elegantly appointed lobby , you will never want to leave . The multiple ballrooms , board rooms and private dining rooms make this the perfect site for weddings or business events . If you 're looking for leisure activities , there are two bars , the Lockwood Wine Cellar , and an indoor pool . The staff is professional , friendly and helpful . Room service is excellent , and the hotel is conveniently placed to several major attractions in the city .

My first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews . For some reason , I kept being disappointed at every turn . Noisy room on the 4th floor . Could not get the room to cool down - it was stifling . BE WARNED - No water , no mini - bar no vending machine , no nothing once you get in your room . You might as well be in prison . They have coffee in the morning , but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days . I guess that is convenient for them , but what about me ? Workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest . The only treadmill I could get on was broken . Guess what a cooler with water in it ! Oh no - it was only stocked for one day . After that nothing . Way to set expectations and then fail to deliver . Same with towels - one day they have them - next day they do n't . They essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $ 10 charge for wireless ( go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free ) . They should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach . I have stayed at much better for less . Wo n't be coming back .

What was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in Chicago turned into a complete disaster . The first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of 6 was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit in ... they knew we had 6 ! We ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel . When we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on 3 different floors despite our request for rooms near each other . After some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor , unfortunately one of the rooms had n't even been cleaned which meant more waiting around . The staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating . On our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 5:30am . Despite my calls to the front desk , the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes . We also did n't know the hotel was sooo pet friendly . One morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door . I understand they allow pets , but really ... people need to clean up after their animals ... or have some dog free floors . While Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms , their service was terrible , the staff was rude , and I still ca n't get over that dog poo in the hallway . I definitely wo n't be staying here again .

I stayed here in the last weekend of September 2010 for the Bears vs Packers Monday Night game . My room rocked ! I had a pretty big flat screen , and a super soft bed . The room was clean and stylish , and the staff was very courteous from check - in to check - out . My favorite part was the amazing bathroom - way better than mine at home . I definitely had a great escape that weekend and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to relax .

So ... the location to the Clark / Lake train stop is great ... and that is the only thing that is great with the hotel . The wall are very thin ... so much you can hear giggling and early morning housekeeping conversations in the hallway . There is no coffee maker in the room , however ; free coffee is available in the lobby ... becuase everyone wants to go to the lobby first thing in the morning ? ? ? Finally , the "" business center "" is a pay for use set - up ... no courtesty internet usage or printing . Lastly ... they bathroom is micro - tiny and lacks in counterspace and comfort .

We stayed in the Conrad for 4 nights just before Thanksgiving . We had a corner room overlooking N Michigan Av and the Tribune Building . To say this is a 5 star hotel is to damn this place with faint praise - it is wonderful . The staff were unbelievably helpful . The standard of the room was superb - HD plasma screens , luxury bedlinens , iPod radio , huge bathroom . Location is unbeatable - right in the heart of everything - watched the whole Light Festival parade from the window . Breakfasts were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service . Would have no hesitation recommending or staying again in this hotel - 5 out of 5 .

I can only confirm the positve reviews previously mentioned . We stayed in room 1112 , King with River View . No noise and very comfortable . The price was a bargain at $ 191 a night . I would stay here again . The "" L "" from Midway Airport lets you off about two blocks from the Hotel . It 's a $ 2 ride - no need for a $ 40 taxi ride .

I booked this hotel with great expectations . I had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago . Upon arriving to the hotel ( at the exact time I indicated in my reservation ) I was told I 've been "" downgraded "" to a lesser quality room . I travel very often and never had this before . Moreover , I did not hear a single "" I 'm sorry "" , it was like usual business . What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me "" I will decrease the rate for you "" "" what do you think , nice eh ? "" like he was doing me a favor ! ! ! ! They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course ( which is the legal thing to do , since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money ) . They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value . I did not know what to say , since this never happened to me before , also with family present did not want to start arguing . The rooms were nice ( not as nice as I thought ) and location is good , however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this . That is enough for me not to go back again .

DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL ! ! ! ! I would have certainly expected more from the Hilton , especially due to the price I paid for my room and the way the hotel is portrayed . Upon arriving at the hotel I found only one receptionist working and she was too busy texting on her mobile phone to check me in ! I had to wait 15 mins before checking in and she made me feel like I was inconveniencing her ! When I finally got into my room I was appalled . I had a non smoking reservation and the room stank of smoke and there were several visible cigarette burns in the comforter and the carpet . I called down to reception and to confirm that I was in a non smoking room , which I was advised that I was . I had to argue with the receptionist over the room for 10 mins before she agreed to switch my room for another one . One I entered my new room , I found that once again it stank of smoke , but after being too exhausted from my flight I decided that I would sort it out with reception in the morning . BAD IDEA ! I curled up and went to sleep and awoke to the go to the bathroom around 2 am where I noticed my legs were COVERED in red welts ! I immediately rushed back into the bedroom and through back the covers to find my bed teaming with bed bugs . I packed my stuff and checked out that night , however a refund was refused . I have since contacted the head office and I am awaiting a response . DO NOT STAY HERE ! ! !

The Palmer House Hilton in Chicago is by far the best experience I have ever had away from home . From the moment you walk into the elegantly appointed lobby , you will never want to leave . The multiple ballrooms , board rooms and private dining rooms make this the perfect site for weddings or business events . If you 're looking for leisure activities , there are two bars , the Lockwood Wine Cellar , and an indoor pool . The staff is professional , friendly and helpful . Room service is excellent , and the hotel is conveniently placed to several major attractions in the city .

My first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews . For some reason , I kept being disappointed at every turn . Noisy room on the 4th floor . Could not get the room to cool down - it was stifling . BE WARNED - No water , no mini - bar no vending machine , no nothing once you get in your room . You might as well be in prison . They have coffee in the morning , but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days . I guess that is convenient for them , but what about me ? Workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest . The only treadmill I could get on was broken . Guess what a cooler with water in it ! Oh no - it was only stocked for one day . After that nothing . Way to set expectations and then fail to deliver . Same with towels - one day they have them - next day they do n't . They essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $ 10 charge for wireless ( go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free ) . They should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach . I have stayed at much better for less . Wo n't be coming back .

What was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in Chicago turned into a complete disaster . The first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of 6 was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit in ... they knew we had 6 ! We ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel . When we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on 3 different floors despite our request for rooms near each other . After some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor , unfortunately one of the rooms had n't even been cleaned which meant more waiting around . The staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating . On our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 5:30am . Despite my calls to the front desk , the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes . We also did n't know the hotel was sooo pet friendly . One morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door . I understand they allow pets , but really ... people need to clean up after their animals ... or have some dog free floors . While Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms , their service was terrible , the staff was rude , and I still ca n't get over that dog poo in the hallway . I definitely wo n't be staying here again .
